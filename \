Made changes to chapter 5. Moved the diagrams so that they are not in their own sections but actually in the overview section of the the particular algorithm being explained. Added a section for each algorithm which discusses the algorithm being applied on the FAP. Also made some extra paragraphs. Finally also typed up as summary for the chapter.
