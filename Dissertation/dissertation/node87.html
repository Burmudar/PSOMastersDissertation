Move Generation</A>
</H3>
Most of the research done on the <#2772#>SA<#2772#> algorithm focuses on the annealing schedule and not so much on the move/solution/neighbourhood generation. Typically an initial solution is generated and then small changes are made to the solution to represent a new solution. The solution is said to be perturbed to the next solution.

<P>
Move generation is the phase where neighbouring solutions to the current solution are generated. It is the ideal section for an algorithm designer to embed domain-specific knowledge which will allow the algorithm to generate better possible solutions.

<P>
In research done by Tseung and Lin [#CurveFittingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] an initial solution is not modified, but a move generation technique known as <I>pattern</I> search is used. Pattern search has two forms of movement, namely the exploratory move and the patten move. The exploratory move continually changes the certain variables of a solution [#CurveFittingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This is done so that the technique can rapidly find and identify a ``downhill'' move. The pattern move uses the information gathered by the exploratory move to move towards the minimum of the function [#CurveFittingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
