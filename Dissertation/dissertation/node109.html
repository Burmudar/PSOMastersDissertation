Introduction</A>
</H1>
The research field of artificial intelligence stands a lot to gain by the study of the inner workings of nature itself; this is why there is a branch of artificial intelligence that incorporates some of nature's processes, like evolution, which can be seen being applied in practice in the <#3695#>GA<#3695#> (see section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:geneticalgorithm#3696><tex2html_cr_mark></A>).

<P>
There are other approaches in artificial intelligence which also have their routes in nature, for instance animal learning or the study of how dogs learn[#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These approaches only look at a “single agent” thought process when agent percepts (senses) are mapped to actions in an agents particular environment [#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
A percept can be said to be a process that is specifically designed to take data from the surrounding environment, process it and present it as information upon which decisions can be made[#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. For instance, eyes are percepts, which take visual data presented by the environment[#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The visual data is processed by the brain into information to enable decisions to be made on navigating the environment[#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The research field of swarm intelligence is an approach more concerned with the underlying processes and behaviour patterns when multiple agents (insects, animals) come together and perform a task as one collective entity[#DLearning#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  The study of animals and insects and how they socially interact within their local environments in groups has already contributed to artificial intelligence as a whole in the form of Swarm Intelligence[#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#BeeJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  In the field of Swarm Intelligence, animals and insects are represented by agents which are simple stimulus-response agents and can only perceive changes in their local environments. A group of agents is referred to as a <I>swarm</I>.

<P>
Swarm intelligence works on a key aspect observed in nature, the notion of emergent behaviour[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Emergent behaviour is when an individual in the swarm achieves success due to the it obtaining more knowledge through exploration about its local environment[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In swarm intelligence, when an agent exhibits emergent behaviour, the outcome of the behaviour needs to be shared with the whole swarm in order for the swarm to adapt and use the newly gained knowledge[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In a swarm, the agents communicate with each other about knowledge gained as a consequence of the changes in their local environments[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Changes can be caused by emergent behaviour by the agent itself, other agents or the environment[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Communication among agents facilitates <I>knowledge sharing</I>[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Social interaction among agents is certainly not the only means of interacting, but with regard to biological inspired systems it is the most prominent[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Using this social interaction between the agents of the swarm can influence their own local environment to move towards more promosing space in the search space [#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus each agents of a swarm contributes to the swarm as a whole to locate and produce better solutions [#BeeJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Due to the social interaction between agents the swarm is also referred to as a <I>social swarm</I>[#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] 

<P>
As discussed the behaviour propagates from one agent to another through social interaction, which brings forth information exchange[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Social interaction is but one component of self-organisation. Other components that form part of self-organisation are [#SIPowerInNums#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

<UL>
<LI>Positive and negative feedback[#SIPowerInNums#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]
</LI>
<LI>Increased fluctuations of random events[#SIPowerInNums#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The means by which agents facilitate indirect communication with each other is known as <I>stigmergy</I>. Stimergy as well as the different forms of stigmergy are discussed in ~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#3724><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
Swarm intelligence algorithms are also meta-heuristic algorithms, with the distinction being made that swarm intelligence algorithms use multiple agents as a collective entity of knowledge to search the problem space[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#BeeJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The initial algorithms developed with regard to swarm intelligence, were based on the coordination and behaviour exhibited by schools of fish and flocks of birds. The newer generation of algorithms include[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ChaoticSwarmIntel#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#BeeJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

<P>
Swarm intelligence based algorithms are able to achieve good results since they have simple individuals searching in their own local environments for more optimal solutions[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A direct consequence of multiple individuals in a swarm searching is that the algorithms are able to explore multple locations within the defined search space[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Traditional single agent based metaheuristic algorithms like <#3740#>TS<#3740#> (section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:tabusearch#3741><tex2html_cr_mark></A>) and <#3742#>SA<#3742#> (section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:simulatedannealing#3743><tex2html_cr_mark></A>) only have in essence one ``individual'' searching for a solution[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
With algorithms like <#3745#>TS<#3745#> and <#3746#>SA<#3746#>, the information is not shared since there is only one individual search[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#SASingleMultiObj#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#TSHazardous#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The information is kept to influence future decisions[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#TabuVechicleRoutingWithTimeWindows#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CurveFittingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#EcoEquilSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Swarm intelligence algorithms also store information for use by the various individuals that make up the swarm to make more informed decisions as the search space is explored[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
NP-Complete optimisation problems are but one of the fields where swarm intelligence algorithms have been adapted to. Other fields where swarm intelligence has been applied include neural network training[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], vehicle routing[#ACOSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], clustering[#AntSwarmClustering#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], search engines and electrical power systems[#SAElectricPower#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Swarm intelligence thus seems more suited towards problems with combinatorial complexity[#SIOPDenby#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The chapter is organised as follows. Before the algorithms are discussed an overview of stigmergy is presented in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#3755><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Starting with section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:ACO#3756><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the first swarm intelligence algorithm is discussed namely, Ant Colony Optimisation. Artificial bee colony is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:BEE#3757><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:PSO#3758><tex2html_cr_mark></A> is a discussion about the Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm. This chapter concludes with section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:SISummary#3759><tex2html_cr_mark></A> that summurises the chapter.
