Single solution based search</A>
</H4>
--- The <#2848#>SA<#2848#> algorithm is similar to the <#2849#>TS<#2849#> algorithm in the sense that it only searches from one solution per iteration. It searches by generating neighbours around the current solution of the algorithm. The <#2850#>FAP<#2850#> search space is huge; hence it would be more efficient to have multiple current solutions from which neighbours are generated. This enables the algorithm to explore the search space much more efficiently at the expense of more computational resources.
