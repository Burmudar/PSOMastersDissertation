Chapter 7</A>
</H3>
This chapter contained an algorithm based on the standard PSO algorithm to operate on the FAP encountered in cellular networks.

<P>
All the various problems as well as how they were solved during the development of the main algorithm of this dissertation were described. For each new or old technique used by the algorithm pseudocode was given for a better idea of how the algorithm uses it.

<P>
The chapter concluded with small additions made to the algorithm to improve performance and, most important of all, improve solution quality.
