The Performance of the PSO</A>
</H1>
In this section the effects of the changes made to the FAP PSO algorithm in terms of the results is discussed. 

<P>
Firstly, the effect of the two developed velocity methods in terms of the results is described. In section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:diffglobalschemes#6638><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the three global schemes that are used by the algorithm are discussed. Finally this section concludes with the effect of a larger population size on solution quality rather than a small population.
