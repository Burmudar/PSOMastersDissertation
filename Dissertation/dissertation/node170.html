Research Questions</A>
</H1>
At the start of the dissertation a series of research questions were outlined. These questions were identified and served as a roadmap to understand the problem domain as well as to gather enough background information on optimisation algorithmic techniques to allow innovation.

<P>
Six questions were identified in total. Each original question will now be listed together with a short discussion on how the question was answered and to which chapter it is related to.

<UL>
<LI><B>Question 1</B> --- <I>What is cellular technology, how was it got developed and what improvements have been made since its initial development?</I> This question was answered in chapter 2, which provided the history of cellular technology and also highlighted improvements that have been made since the inception of cellular networks.
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 2</B> --- <I>What is the architecture behind a modern cellular network, how do the various hardware entities within a network communicate with each other and how is a communicational link established between two users of the network?</I> This question was answered in chapter 2 where the architecture of a modern-day cellular network was outlined and discussed in depth. Each entity used by the network to facilitate communication was identified and discussed in detail.
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 3</B> --- <I>What exactly is the frequency problem and how does it affect modern wireless communication? </I> This question was answered in chapter 3, which contains a description of the general problem of the frequency assignment problem as well as exactly what happens in a cellular network for this problem to occur.
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 4</B> --- <I>What variants of the frequency problem exist and which are most applicable to cellular networks?</I> The variants that currently exist in the problem domain were listed in chapter 3, together with their respective history and what domain they affect. The particular variant concentrated on in this dissertation concentrated on was formally stated. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 5</B> --- <I>What are the most popular optimisation algorithms and what characteristics make them unique?</I> This question was answered in two chapters namely chapters 4 and 5. In these chapters the most popular and modern optimisation algorithms were evaluated.
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 6</B> --- <I>With algorithms that achieved success in their respective optimisation problems, what particular technique is used by the algorithms that them it to achieve better performance?</I> Chapters 4 and 5 covered modern optimisation algorithms, which were also evaluated. Exactly what made the algorithm unique and allowed it to achieve success in the domain it was applied to was also dealt with
