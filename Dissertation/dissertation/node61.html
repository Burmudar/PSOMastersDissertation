Wireless mesh networks and WLANs are the most recent applications where the <#2073#>FAP<#2073#> is encountered. 

<P>
Multiple WLANs are increasingly being used to provide backbone support for large fixed line networks, enterprise networks, campuses and metropolitan areas[#MultiradioMeshNetworks#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. To be able to provide backbone support for these networks, a primary design goal when designing and deploying these networks is capacity[#MultiradioMeshNetworks#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A limiting factor for WLAN capacity is interference, which affects multihop hop settings. Thus the overall network interference needs to be minimized to increase the capacity of the network [#MultiradioMeshNetworks#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Typical approaches allocating frequencies include using <#2077#>DFA<#2077#> and <#2078#>FFA<#2078#> (discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FreqAssignmentTypes#2079><tex2html_cr_mark></A>). <#2080#>DFA<#2080#> is not very popular because the dynamic switching of frequencies lowers the response time on commodity hardware since there is a delay in milliseconds when switching frequencies. Typical packet transmission times are in microseconds. To guarantee uptime and high responsiveness, <#2081#>FFA<#2081#> is the preferred approach [#MultiradioMeshNetworks#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#2083#>FAP<#2083#> in wireless mesh networks and WLANs differs from the standard problem in that it introduces an extra constraint. Channels assigned to links on a node cannot be more than the available interfaces on that particular node. This constraint is known as the <I>interface constraint</I> [#MultiradioMeshNetworks#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Another aspect to consider is the placement of access points (APs) in the network, which is similar to the problem cellular networks face with regard to base station placement [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
