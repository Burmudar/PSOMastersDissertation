In this chapter a discussion was presented on three swarm intelligence algorithms. For each of the three algorithms a flow chart was given to allow the reader a more visual view of the operation of the algorithm. 

<P>
Each algorithm was analysed in detail to identify its strengths and the techniques it uses to achieve good results. Finally the algorithm was critically evaluated in the terms of being applied to the FAP.
