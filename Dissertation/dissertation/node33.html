Network Management Centre</A>

--- The <#912#>NMC<#912#> is similar to the <#913#>OMC<#913#> but it is not restricted to only regional <#914#>gsm<#914#> network components as it is in charge of all the <#915#>gsm<#915#> network components in the network[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#917#>NMC<#917#> provides traffic management for the global network and also monitors high priority alarms such as overloaded or failed <#918#>gsm<#918#> network components[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It is usually used in long-term planning of a network, but it has the capability to perform certain <#920#>OMC<#920#> functions when a <#921#>OMC<#921#> is not staffed.
