In this chapter a series of mathematical optimisation problems were presented. Each problem was mathematically formulated as well as categorised as to whether the particular problem was multimodal and separable.
To get a better idea of how the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm operates and performs, two PSO algorithms were developed. Finally, this chapter concluded with the results obtained by the algorithms.
