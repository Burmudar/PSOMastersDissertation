Pheromone Trail
</H3>
The pheromone technique used by ants forms part of the core methodology used by the <#3866#>ACO<#3866#> algorithm [#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As an ant moves it lays down pheromones to mark the path it is walking.

<P>
With the use of pheromones ants are able to communicate the best and shortest link between nodes[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The more ants following a preferred link the more pheromones would be deposited on that specific link. This increases the strength of the pheromones [#ImpACOComplex#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The increase in strength of the pheromones on a link would thus let ants more clearly distinguish between links they should and should not take [#ImpACOComplex#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore, a pheromone provides positive feedback to the colony[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Initially, all the ants will choose a random link to a node[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. After all the ants have completed their paths, each path is evaluated using a cost function defined by the problem domain[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The amount of pheromone marking the links contained in a path in the standard <#3874#>ACO<#3874#> is related to the cost function[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore, a low cost function value will have a high pheromone dosage and a high cost function value will have a low dosage[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
By incorporating the cost of a particular path into the amount of pheromone deposited the colony is able to influcence future decisions[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In terms of minimisation a path with a low cost will have a high pheromone value making the links of path more likely to be selected by future ants[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the iterations following the initial one, the ants will at each node decide based on a probability whether it should to a particular neighbouring node. The higher the pheromone intensity is at a neighbouring node, the higher the probability that the ant will choose to move towards that node[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The probability with which ants choose links to neighbouring nodes are defined and discussed in the next section.

<P>
Due to ants choosing links to node based on a probability, it is still possible for the ant to choose a random link towards an other node. Thus the <#3880#>ACO<#3880#> algorithms are considered stochastic search procedures due to the ants ability to choose links randomly when exploring the search space [#ACOSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ImpACOComplex#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The pheromone trail was initially developed with only one colony in mind [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In research done by Tiwari et al.[#ACOLargeProblem#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] pheromones in multiple colonies are considered. The basic principle of how pheromones are used by the ants stays the same, but the meaning of the pheromone changes if an ant of another colony encounters the pheromone trail[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The ant will not follow or even consider the pheromone trail since any pheromone encountered from other colonies repulses the ant[#ACOLargeProblem#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus pheromones only provide positive feedback if the ant is from the same colony, otherwise the pheromone gives negative feedback, in a way warning the ant to stay away[#ACOLargeProblem#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This repulsion strategy promotes exploration among the multiple colonies[#ACOLargeProblem#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The probability with which a link towards a particular node is chosen by an ant forms part of the <I>state transition rules</I>.
