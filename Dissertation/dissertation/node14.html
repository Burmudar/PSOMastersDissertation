This chapter is concerned with providing algorithms that are new in the research domain of optimisation algorithms. The algorithms presented in chapter 4 are fairly old and have been applied to a wide variety of problems. Algorithms in this chapter are relatively new in the optimisation domain and have not been applied to the same number of problems as the algorithms in chapter 4. In this chapter swarm algorithms are presented and the algorithms have the particular characteristic that they are based generally on processes observed in nature. Each algorithm is discussed in depth with its core characteristics outlined. Furthermore for each algorithm an analysis is given if the algorithm were to be applied to the frequency assignment problem. Finally it is formally stated what algorithm this dissertation is applied to the frequency assignment problem in this research.
