Simulated Annealing on the FAP</A>

The <#2812#>SA<#2812#> algorithm, as with the <#2813#>TS<#2813#> algorithm, has achieved good results in other optimisation problems, as mentioned in section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:SAIntroduction#2814><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Due to its success on other NP-Complete optimisation problems, the <#2815#>SA<#2815#> algorithm has also been applied to the <#2816#>FAP<#2816#>.

<P>
In literature by Carlo Mannino and Gianpaolo Oriolo[#SolvingSuperIntervalGraphs#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] the <#2818#>SA<#2818#> algorithm is applied to the <#2819#>FAP<#2819#>. The resulting <#2820#>SA<#2820#> algorithm was benchmarked on the <#2821#>COST<#2821#> 259 Siemens benchmark instances. The results obtained by the authors are presented in table~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#tab:SA#2822><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

Values represent the total interference generated by the frequency assignment. Note that the values represented in the SA column, are the values as presented in the reasearch by the authors. Also, note that the column <#2833#>COST<#2833#> 259 (old) represents the best obtained results to the instances as it was when the authors presented their research.
An overview of the <#2834#>SA<#2834#> algorithm along with its unique characteristics have now been given. Utilising the knowledge that was gained from understanding how the <#2835#>SA<#2835#> algorithm operates a critical evaluation can be presented. In the following paragraphs, a theoretical critical evaluation is presented that lists the various characteristics which would be problematic if the <#2836#>SA<#2836#> algorithm would be applied to the <#2837#>FAP<#2837#>.
