--- The <#892#>OMC<#892#> is capable of communicating with <#893#>gsm<#893#> network components using two protocols, namely SS7 and X.25[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The SS7 protocol is usually used when the <#895#>OMC<#895#> is communicating within the <#896#>gsm<#896#> network over short and medium distances[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The X.25 protocol is used for large external data transfers[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. All communication where the <#899#>OMC<#899#> is involved occurs over fixed line networks and/or leased lines. The <#900#>OMC<#900#> is usually used for day-to-day operation of a network [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#902#>OMC<#902#> has support for alarm handling[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. An alarm in a <#904#>gsm<#904#> network goes off whenever a predefined expected condition does occur. Engineers are able to define the severity of an alarm, which defines who or what is further alerted and if the alarm needs to be escalated to a higher level [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#906#>OMC<#906#> is also capable of fault management in the <#907#>gsm<#907#> network[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It is able to activate, deactivate, remove and restore a service manually or automatically on network devices[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Various tests can be run and diagnostic information can be retrieved on the network devices to detect any current or future defects [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
