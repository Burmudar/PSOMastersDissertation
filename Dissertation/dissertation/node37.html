In this chapter a broad discussion was given of modern cellular technology, specifically <#1405#>gsm<#1405#> cellular network technology. A brief history on how <#1406#>gsm<#1406#> was developed to be the most widely used cellular technology in use today was provided. The <#1407#>gsm<#1407#> architecture components followed. In the <#1408#>gsm<#1408#> architecture all the network components present in a modern <#1409#>gsm<#1409#> network were identified.

<P>
Following the discussion of the <#1410#>gsm<#1410#> network components, a broad overview was given of the communication interfaces used between the <#1411#>gsm<#1411#> network components to communicate with each other. This was followed by a definition of the <#1412#>gsm<#1412#> channels which are used on the interfaces to communicate information.

<P>
The chapter concluded with the handover process which is used to allow an <#1413#>MS<#1413#> device to move freely geographically within the network.
