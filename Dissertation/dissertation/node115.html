Pheromone Evaporation
</H3>
Initially when the pheromone concept was first implemented the ants of the colony rapidly converged on a solution[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The search space was not adequately explored and the produced solution was of local optima[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. To combat this premature convergence and force the ants to explore the search space more, the concept of <I>pheromone evaporation</I> was introduced[#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Real pheromones used by ants to mark a particular link to a node is not permanent and over time the strength of the pheromone deteriorates until it eventually disappears[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Pheromone deteriorating is known in the literature as pheromone evaporation[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The pheromone will not completely evaporate as long there are ants traversing the defined link reinforcing the pheromone. The evaporation of pheromones is modelled in the <#3897#>ACO<#3897#> by equation <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#eq:pheromoneevapuration#3898><tex2html_cr_mark></A>[#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

The constant <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15321#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# defines the rate at which the pheromone evaporates. If <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15323#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# the pheromone completely evaporates every iteration. With no pheromone on a link towards a node the ants take no knowledge gained from the previous iteration into account and therefore select a link randomly [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus, the amount of exploration done by the algorithm can be controlled by the constant <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15325#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Equation <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#eq:pheromoneevapuration#3907><tex2html_cr_mark></A> was first introduced in the <#3908#>AS<#3908#> [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Most subsequent algorithms that are a form of the <#3910#>ACO<#3910#> class of algorithms also use the concept of pheromone evaporation, but they either use the standard equation or develop their own variant [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A more aggressive form of pheromone evaporation  is added to the <#3912#>AS<#3912#> discussed in the research done by Gambardella et. al[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The more aggressive form works beside the already present pheromone evaporation, but this form seeks to add an additional search phase called <I>diversification</I>[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The aim of the diversification phase is to lead the algorithm into another direction of the search space[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This is done in an attempt to avoid local minima and stagnation[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the ant system developed by Gambardella et. al. the algorithm continually monitors the current best solution and keeps a history of recent best solutions[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. If the algorithm starts to notice that solutions are cycling or that the current best solution has not changed for a certain number of iterations, the algorithm activates the diversification phase[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In this phase the algorithm is forced to re-search the search space to create new solutions, as it cannot rely on previous historical information provided by the pheromone trails[#AntQAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
