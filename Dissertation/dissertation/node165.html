Different Global Schemes
</H2>
In the previous chapter three global selection schemes were identified. The first global selection scheme uses the standard PSO selection and the particle with the best fitness is the global best. This scheme is called ``Standard GBest''.

<P>
As discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:buildglobalbest#6645><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, using the standard gbest selection scheme is not preferable as it can lead to the swarm losing out on good frequency allocations due to overshadowing of frequencies<A NAME="tex2html40"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot6653"><SUP>7.1</SUP></A>.

<P>
Even with overshadowing the standard global scheme does not produce bad results, which seems to indicate that overshadowing of frequency allocations does not impact the frequency plans as significantly as thought initially.

<P>
In addition to the standard gbest selection scheme, two other selection schemes were tested. It is actually incorrect to call these schemes selection schemes of gbest, since they build global best rather than select them.

<P>
By far the worst performing scheme is where the global best is built from transceivers. In every benchmark performed where this scheme was paired with a velocity method and population size, the algorithm was simply not able to produce any relatively good solutions. All possible solutions had high interference values, making them undesirable.

<P>
The bad performance of the build from transceivers scheme can be attributed to the granularity it uses to build a global best. As outlined in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:buildglobalbest#6647><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the scheme only considers the interference generated by a single frequency allocated to a transceiver. This would have worked well if there were some sort of guarantee that a particular transceiver would only be interfered with by one other transceiver.

<P>
In reality and in the Siemens4 benchmarks this is definitely not the case. More often than not, transceivers are interfered with by more than one other transceiver. Thus by only concentrating on a single case-by-case basis of frequencies allocated to transceivers, the scheme is discarding all other possible interferences. 

<P>
It might select a frequency at one point as the best, since in that scenario, the interference generated with the only other transceiver that is considered at that point is low. But this particular frequency is too close on the spectrum to another frequency allocated to some other transceiver that also interferes. Due to the algorithm only considering individual cases, this potential interference with the other transceiver will not be noticed by the algorithm and it will go ahead in selecting the frequency as the best for the transceiver.

<P>
By analysing the results produced by the various FAP PSO algorithms, it can be concluded that the best global best selection scheme is by far the one in which cells are used to build a global best. With the cell selection scheme, the algorithm does not suffer the pitfall that is the reason for the transceiver gbest building scheme's bad performance.

<P>
As discussed the build from cells scheme uses cells to build a gbest, and thus each cell stores the interference that the frequencies allocated to its transceivers generate by interfering with other cells. As a cell interferes with other cells, the interference generated is added to the cell causing the interference.

<P>
After the PSO has calculated the fitness of all positions, each cell will contain the interference it personally has caused throughout the network to other cells. A cell with low interference means the frequencies that have been allocated to this particular cell are the best combination which causes the least amount of interference. Therefore, with the build gbest from cells scheme, the algorithm is able to make informed choices when selecting a cell to be included in the global best.
