Memory Usage</A>

--- The algorithm requires a fair amount of memory. The memory is used to keep track of each permutation of a particular cell and its allocated frequencies until the pheromone that links to the cell has decayed enough to be discarded. As an ant moves from one cell to another, it might not select the previous cell (due to probability) to move to, but rather generates an entirely new cell to move towards. This newly generated cell would then be linked to the previous cell, and therefore the algorithm needs to keep track of the pheromone on that link until it has completely been decayed away. The algorithm needs to keep track of these pheromones on the links even if the new link to the generated cell is not even close to optimal and has very high interference.
