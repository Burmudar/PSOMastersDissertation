Initial Population Generation</A>
</H3>
Initial population generation is the very first activity that the <#2985#>GA<#2985#> performs. Out of this population potential mating candidates are selected based on their fitness, which indicates desirability. The initial population is generated by means of randomisation [#SelfAdaptiveGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Since the algorithm searches multiple points simultaneously in the search space, it is desirable that the initial population have a wide diversity with regard to the problem search space[#CombinedBranchBoundGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DistributedHierarchicalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By controlling the initial population generation we can control, to a small degree, the amount of exploration the algorithm does initially[#CombinedBranchBoundGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore care must be taken in the selection of the particular randomisation scheme that will be used to generate chromosomes for individuals.

<P>
In a survey done by Andrea Reese[#RandomNumberGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], two randomisation schemes were defined, namely  <#2990#>PRNG<#2990#> and <#2991#>QRNG<#2991#>. <#2992#>PRNG<#2992#> were found to be heavily problem dependent, improving the search efficiency in some instances and in other instances having no considerable impact. QRNGs, on the other hand, were shown to significantly improve the final solution produced by the <#2993#>GA<#2993#> as well as lower the number of generations for the solution to be obtained [#RandomNumberGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
