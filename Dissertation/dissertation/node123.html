Introduction</A>

The <#4117#>ABC<#4117#> algorithm is the most recently presented algorithm in the literature discussed in this chapter[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCLeafConstrained#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The algorithm was first proposed by Karaboga in 2005 who wanted to mimic the foraging behaviour exhibited by bees [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCLeafConstrained#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Like ants, bees need to gather food to support the colony. To understand how the <#4120#>ABC<#4120#> algorithm tries to mimic the foraging behaviour of bees, this behaviour of real bees needs to be described first[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
In a bee colony there are numerous bees, each with a specific role that dictates what actions a bee can perform. There are bees that protect the queen, maintain the colony, scout for resources and gather food, i.e the worker bees. The most important bees for foraging are those that scout and gather food[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The scout bees are sent out and as their role implies, are responsible for exploring the surroundings of the hive to find suitable food sources[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. If a scout bee has found a food source it needs to return to the colony to share the information with the worker bees[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When the bee enters the colony it needs to communicate to the other bees by using some form of stigmergy (see section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#4125><tex2html_cr_mark></A>)[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The scout bee accomplishes this communication by performing a dance known as the <I>waggle dance</I> in the colony for all the bees to see[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This is not a dance as in the traditional sense, since through certain movements the bee is able to communicate a variety of characteristics about the food source including[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

<UL>
<LI>How far the food source is from the colony
</LI>
<LI>Quality of the food source
</LI>
<LI>Path towards the food source
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
It can be concluded that foraging bees use <I>sematectonic</I> stigmergy (discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#4133><tex2html_cr_mark></A>). This is deduced from the dance which is a physical form of communication.

<P>
The dance is observed by <I>onlooker</I> worker bees [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These onlooker bees are initially <I>unemployed</I> in the colony [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Once the information of the scout has been transferred to the onlooker bees, the onlooker bees become <I>employed</I> bees[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. They become employed bees when they operate on a particular food source to gather food[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus it is the job of the worker bees to <I>exploit</I> the information provided by the <I>exploration</I> done by the scout bees [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Worker bees gather food from the designated food source, until the food source reaches a certain quantity with regard to nectar content [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each time the bee returns to the colony it evaluates the current food source versus other food sources discovered [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. If a better food source is found, the bee abandons the previous source and starts gathering food from the new source [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. On the other hand, if the food source has been exhausted, meaning there is no more nectar content to gather, the bee returns to the colony and becomes ``unemployed'' [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the <#4148#>ABC<#4148#> algorithm, possible solutions are considered to be food sources[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each food source has an employed bee associated with it. Onlooker bees either wait for new food sources to be communicated to them or become employed bees by moving to another, more attractive food source [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
A food source might be more attractive to a bee because its defined nectar content is more than that of the current food source the bee is operating on[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The nectar content of a food source can be considered to be the fitness, which is determined using the fitness function of the specific problem domain[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
As with real honey bees, a <I>waggle dance</I> is performed to all the onlooker bees by employed bees that provide information on the nectar amount (fitness value) that they represent [#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The onlooker bees choose food sources depending on the nectar amount [#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]; therefore as the nectar amount of a food source increases, the probability that more onlooker bees will choose the source increases [#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. How and what affects the probability is discussed in the next subsection.

<P>
Bees can transition to different roles depending on their situation [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. An onlooker bee becomes employed when assigned to a food source and an employed bee can become a scout if its initial food source becomes exhausted [#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Note that not all employed bees of a food source become scouts; only the first employed bee of a food source transitions to a scout [#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Scout bees are sent to randomly generated food sources [#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The more onlooker bees a food source attracts, the more the neighbourhood will be explored since the onlooker bees move to the food source and choose an immediate neighbouring food source to be employed upon [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus, this can be considered exploitation and the algorithm is therefore performing a local search[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Finally, the number of onlooker bees a food source has also indicates its desirability. A very good solution will have the majority of onlooker bees choosing it and searching for nearby better food sources [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. More bees are lured towards a particular food source due to the high nectar amount that has been communicated to them by other employed bees[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
When a food source is abandoned, the previous bee that occupied the food source transitions to a scout bee [#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The scout bee is responsible for replacing the abandoned food source by finding a new one, and a new food source is generated and communicated back to the colony[#ABCCompareStudy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCImageEnhancement#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The generation of food sources is discussed in the next subsection.

<P>
Karaboga was not the first to base an algorithm on the above foraging behaviour. Other bee foraging inspired algorithms have been developed such as the BeeHive algorithm, <#4167#>BCO<#4167#> and <#4168#>BSO<#4168#> [#BCO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#HybridABCClustering#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The BeeHive algorithm is based on the dance communication used inside the colony of bees. In <#4170#>BCO<#4170#> solutions are randomly generated and assigned to bees[#HybridABCClustering#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Finally, <#4172#>BSO<#4172#> solutions are iteratively constructed by forager (worker) bees and the best solution is communicated to the rest of the colony by performing a dance[#HybridABCClustering#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Another bee algorithm is the <#4174#>VBA<#4174#> which, like the previous algorithms, is also based on the foraging behaviour of bees, but it differs in that it is not designed for combinatorial problems [#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Instead the <#4176#>VBA<#4176#> is a variant of the standard <#4177#>ABC<#4177#> algorithm which is designed for numerical function optimisation [#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In <#4179#>VBA<#4179#> bees move around in the search space communicating to each other any target nectar food sources that are found[#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Good food sources are function evaluations of particular coordinates in the numerical search space which produce low function evaluation values in the case of minimisation[#ABCNumericalOptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Karaboga developed the <#4182#>ABC<#4182#> algorithm based on the previous research done on bee colony optimisation and the above algorithms. The <#4183#>ABC<#4183#> algorithm is designed to be a multivariable optimisation algorithm and has to date been applied to the job scheduling problem, clustering [#HybridABCClustering#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], neural network training and reconfiguration of distribution networks [#ABCReconfigDistro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Due to the nature of the algorithm being similar to that of the <#4186#>ACO<#4186#>, the <#4187#>ABC<#4187#> algorithm will most likely also be applied to a whole host of other of problems.

<P>
