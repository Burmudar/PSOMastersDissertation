In a <#878#>gsm<#878#> network most of the elements that form part of and make the network function are often distributed in a wide geographical area to provide the best network coverage for the customer[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
For a network to function properly and efficiently network engineers need to be kept up to date on the state of the network and be alerted if <I>any</I> problems occur[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. For this purpose there are two systems in the <#882#>gsm<#882#> network architecture that allow for this functionality required by network engineers[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
One system is called the <#884#>OMC<#884#> which is responsible for centralised regional and local operational and maintenance activities[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The other system is called the <#886#>NMC<#886#> and unlike the <#887#>OMC<#887#> it provides global and centralised management for operations and maintenance of the network supported by the OMCs [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the following paragraphs more in depth discussions on the critical functions the <#889#>OMC<#889#> and <#890#>NMC<#890#> perform is presented.

<P>
