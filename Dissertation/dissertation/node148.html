Velocity Function for Frequency Planning
</H1>
The elocity function is arguably the core of the <#5549#>PSO<#5549#> algorithm. It is the procedure by which particles in the swarm move from one point to another in the solution space. 

<P>
The velocity function does not blindly move a particle from one point to another, but instead it takes the particle history into account as well as the best particle in the swarm. Therefore the velocity function is the core means by which the swarm explores the solution space. A more thorough explanation is provided in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:particleVelocity#5550><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The development of a velocity function that is suitable for particles to move from one frequency plan to another is covered next. The section will start off with the first velocity function that was developed. With each method discussed, the problems associated with it will also be mentioned. 

<P>
This section will conclude with the second method that was developed and that is also the primary method the developed <#5551#>PSO<#5551#> uses.
