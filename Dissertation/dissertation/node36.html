Handover
</H1>
The handover process in a <#1253#>gsm<#1253#> network is initiated when an <#1254#>MS<#1254#> with an active call moves outside the coverage area of a cell, <#1255#>BSS<#1255#> or <#1256#>MSC<#1256#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A handover might also be initiated because of measurements indicating bad channel quality[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Various information needs to be migrated across and shared between the components handling the calls to ensure a smooth handover. Not only the <#1259#>gsm<#1259#> architecture components that need to continuously share information but also the <#1260#>MS<#1260#>. The <#1261#>MS<#1261#> is required to continuously observe and measure signal strength of up to 6 neighbouring cells. The <#1262#>MS<#1262#> does this by monitoring the <#1263#>BCCH<#1263#>[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This information is of course relayed to the <#1265#>MSC<#1265#> and <#1266#>BTS<#1266#>. The information plays a critical role in the decision process as to which entity will be the best in taking over the administration of the active call[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
An <#1268#>MS<#1268#> can in some cases receive the same <#1269#>BCCH<#1269#> from different cells, which are most likely neighbours [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This problem of duplicate <#1271#>BCCH<#1271#> from different cells can be attributed to the frequency reuse in the cellular network as well as to the smaller sector cells forming clusters and therefore overlapping coverage area [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#def:cellsector#1273><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, cells are divided into sectors, which lessen the problem of co-channel interference. This division into sectors can cause clustering of cells and overlapping of coverage area.

<P>
This creates a problem for the <#1274#>MS<#1274#> since it needs to distinguish between the two cell measurements as it does not know which measurement belongs to which cell[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. To distinguish between different cells, the <#1276#>MS<#1276#> also tries to determine the identity of each cell it is monitoring. Only cells whose identity can be determined reliably are included in the report sent to the BTS[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]<A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1278"><SUP>2.4</SUP></A>. Using this report the handover algorithm is able to decide how to handle the handover, and which cell needs to take over the call[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Once the cell has been selected, the actual handover process starts. Which has to take into account that the frequency allocated to the incoming call from the other cell does not interfere with other present active calls in the cell receiving the handover[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A frequency interfering with calls currently active in the cell can cause users to hear other conversations from the interfering call, or experience their call being ``dropped'' i.e. disconnected[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
There are three core handover procedures when a handover needs to occur in a <#1282#>gsm<#1282#> network: <I>intra-BSC</I>, <I>inter-BSC</I> and <I>inter-MSC</I>, each of which involves different <#1286#>gsm<#1286#> network components [#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<DD><#1425#><B>Intra-BSC</B><#1425#> --- Also known as <I>intercell handover</I>, this handover is concerned with the transfer of an active call/connection from an <#1291#>MS<#1291#> to another cell which is controlled by the same <#1292#>BSC<#1292#> as the current cell[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The current <#1294#>BTS<#1294#> that manages the active call of the <#1295#>MS<#1295#> constructs a report containing measurement information from the MS, as well as measurements the <#1296#>BTS<#1296#> has taken on signal strength and error bit ratio of the current connection[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The error bit ratio is defined as how often part of the data being sent over a connection needs to be retransmitted because an error occured[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. An error can be caused by interference, faulty hardware or the signal strenght is fading[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The constructed report is forwarded to the managing <#1300#>BSC<#1300#>. The report is analysed to determine the necessity of handing over the active call to another <#1301#>BTS<#1301#>. If a handover is deemed necessary, the <#1302#>BSC<#1302#> starts by initialising the <#1303#>BTS<#1303#> to prepare it to handle the new connection[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#1305#>BSC<#1305#> then notifies the <#1306#>MS<#1306#> through the old <#1307#>BTS<#1307#> of the new <#1308#>BTS<#1308#> identity, and properties of the new connection such as <#1309#>TCH<#1309#> frequency, power output etc. After receiving the information about the new connection, the <#1310#>MS<#1310#> makes the necessary adjustments for it to continue operating and handling the call on the new connection[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Once all the adjustments have been made the <#1312#>MS<#1312#> sends a confirmation to the <#1313#>BSC<#1313#> of the successful handover through the new <#1314#>BTS<#1314#>. The <#1315#>BSC<#1315#> instructs the old <#1316#>BTS<#1316#> that it must relinquish the use of the <#1317#>TCH<#1317#> and its associated <#1318#>SDCCH<#1318#> used by the old <#1319#>MS<#1319#> call. The <#1320#>BSC<#1320#> notifies the <#1321#>MSC<#1321#> of the handover as it is used in network operation reports[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<DD><#1426#><B>Inter-BSC</B><#1426#> --- In an inter-<#1324#>BSC<#1324#> handover a call of an <#1325#>MS<#1325#> that is being managed by a <#1326#>BTS<#1326#> is transferred to another <#1327#>BTS<#1327#> which has a <I>different</I> controlling <#1329#>BSC<#1329#>. Thus, the call is essentially moved between two <#1330#>BSC<#1330#>, and it is up to the new control <#1331#>BSC<#1331#> to select a suitable <#1332#>BTS<#1332#> that will actually handle the call of the <#1333#>MS<#1333#> being handed over[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
This handover occurs because the <#1335#>MS<#1335#> is moving or is about to move into a cell that is not controlled by the current <#1336#>BSC<#1336#>. The current <#1337#>BSC<#1337#> detects this and therefore takes the necessary precautions to ensure that the new <#1338#>BSC<#1338#> is able to make suitable provision to assume control of the call within one of its BTSs[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#1340#>BSC<#1340#> informs the managing <#1341#>MSC<#1341#> that a handover to another <#1342#>BSC<#1342#> must occur. The request sent to the <#1343#>MSC<#1343#> contains the identity of the cell managed by a different BSC. The <#1344#>MSC<#1344#> determines the managing <#1345#>BSC<#1345#> of the cell in question and notifies it that it must select and prepare the cell for handover. The new <#1346#>BSC<#1346#> informs the cell to create a new connection, which will be used by the <#1347#>MS<#1347#> once the handover is complete[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The new <#1349#>BSC<#1349#> informs the <#1350#>MSC<#1350#> of the new connection details which the cell will use to handle the handover and maintain the active connection of the <#1351#>MS<#1351#>[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1353#>MSC<#1353#> forwards the connection information to the old <#1354#>BSC<#1354#>, which forwards it to the <#1355#>MS<#1355#>[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1357#>MS<#1357#> makes the necessary adjustments for it and then moves on to the new connection. The <#1358#>MS<#1358#> informs the new <#1359#>BSC<#1359#> that the handover has been completed successfully[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The new <#1361#>BSC<#1361#> informs the <#1362#>MSC<#1362#>, which then instructs the old <#1363#>BSC<#1363#> to relinquish the old connection used by the <#1364#>MS<#1364#>[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
