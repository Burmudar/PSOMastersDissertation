Satellite Communication</A>
</H2>
The <#2063#>FAP<#2063#> in the satellite communication domain occurs in the ground terminals that transmit and receive signals via a satellite[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. One would assume that the problem includes the satellite as it handles a variety and order of magnitude more connections than a ground station at any given moment. In fact, the problem is only concerned with the frequencies that the ground terminals use[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In Satellite communication, a signal is transmitted to one or more satellites via an uplink from a ground terminal[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The signal is received by the recipient satellite and relayed via downlink to those ground terminals which have expressed interest in signals from other ground terminals[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A large distance in the frequency domain separates the frequencies used by the ground terminals for uplink and downlink communication. The typical distance is much larger than the bandwidth. When frequencies are assigned to transmitters, downlink transmitters are ignored and only uplink transmitters are considered [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
A radical difference with regard to the use of frequencies compared with the standard <#2069#>FAP<#2069#> in cellular networks is that frequencies are only allowed to be used once[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This is specific to the satellite domain to avoid interference[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
