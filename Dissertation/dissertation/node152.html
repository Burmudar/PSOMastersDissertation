Building a Global Best
</H1>
Selection of the global best particle by the swarm is a very important procedure. After the swarm has determined which particle has achieved the best position, the swarm enters the velocity function phase. 

<P>
As discussed previously each particle position is then modified to move in the general direction of the global best and personal best position. Therefore the global best acts as a beacon for the rest of the swarm in the solution space to indicate where good solutions seem to be for the rest of the swarm.

<P>

<BR>

<P>
Initially the <#5745#>FAP<#5745#> <#5746#>PSO<#5746#> algorithm used the standard method for selecting the global best particle from the swarm and did not differ at all from the traditional global <#5747#>PSO<#5747#> algorithm. The standard global best selection is listed in algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:psogbestselection#5748><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. 

<P>
As can be observed in lines 2 -- 8 the <#5749#>FAP<#5749#> <#5750#>PSO<#5750#> algorithm loops through all the particles in the swarm and applies the fitness function to evaluate the fitness of the particle's position. The fitness value is also referred to as the cost. In the <#5751#>FAP<#5751#> <#5752#>PSO<#5752#> the cost or fitness value of a particle position is the amount of interference the frequency plan that represents the particles position generates.

<P>
A low cost value is preferred to a high cost value, since a low cost value indicates low interference. In lines 4 -- 6 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:psogbestselection#5753><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the <#5754#>FAP<#5754#> <#5755#>PSO<#5755#> algorithm determines whether the current particle position has a lower cost value than the current global best particle position.

<P>
If the current particle position evaluates to a lower cost value than the stored global best, the algorithm replaces the current global best with the current particle being evaluated, which in the algorithm is <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15681#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#.

<P>
Selecting the global best by evaluating the position as a whole seems to be a natural fit. As outlined in the critical evaluation of each algorithm in chapters~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:heuristic#5756><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:swarm#5757><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, some of the algorithms had a problem with regard to some cells or even transceivers overshadowing better cells or transceivers.

<P>
For this dissertation, overshadowing is a term that describes a scenario where a bad value of one part of the frequency plan is so large that it causes other smaller values within the frequency plan not to be considered. 

<P>
As per the following example a few cells in a frequency plan might have the worst possible frequencies assigned to their respective transceivers, and other might have the best. Now the few cells with the worst frequencies generate a great deal of interference, whereas the cells with the best frequencies generate almost nothing.

<P>
When the example frequency plan is evaluated, the bad cells push up the cost value. The high cost value of the frequency plan causes the <#5758#>PSO<#5758#> algorithm to disregard the whole plan. By discarding the whole plan the <#5759#>FAP<#5759#> <#5760#>PSO<#5760#> algorithm loses the knowledge gained on the few cells that had their best frequencies assigned to their respective transceivers.

<P>
In the traditional method of selecting the global best, a particle is actually selected as the swarm best because it contains fewer overshadowing cells or transceivers, and potentially good frequency assignments are lost.

<P>
The <#5761#>FAP<#5761#> <#5762#>PSO<#5762#> therefore needed to exploit the knowledge that the fitness function exposes much more thoroughly. The information exposed by the fitness function allows one to see what effects certain frequency assignments have on the interference of the cell when assigned to the individual transceivers. To make better use of this fitness information two methods were developed for the <#5763#>FAP<#5763#> <#5764#>PSO<#5764#> , each one being finer grained than the other.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Besides the particle storing its fitness or cost, the particle also needed to store the interference generated by an entire cell due to the frequencies allocated to its installed transceivers.
</LI>
<LI>Besides the particle storing the total fitness, it also needed to store the interference generated by a frequency allocated to a particular transceiver of a cell.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
With both these methods, the global best selection scheme needs to be changed to allow the swarm to take advantage of this newly exposed information. As discussed, initially the <#5767#>FAP<#5767#> <#5768#>PSO<#5768#> used the standard global best selection scheme listed in algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:psogbestselection#5769><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, but now with these new methods, a global best position is no longer selected, but built.

<P>
Before the <#5770#>FAP<#5770#> <#5771#>PSO<#5771#> is able to build a global best, the way a particle stores its evaluated fitness needs to change. For the standard global selection scheme, the particle only needs to store one fitness value that is a result of evaluating the whole frequency plan. To be able to build a global best as described above, the fitness value cannot simply be one lump sum representing interference. Instead in the <#5772#>FAP<#5772#> <#5773#>PSO<#5773#> algorithm the interference generated by every transceiver is stored.

<P>
The <#5774#>FAP<#5774#> <#5775#>PSO<#5775#> is able to know the performance of every single frequency allocated to a particular transceiver and also compare the allocation with other similar transceivers in other frequency plans.

<P>
Each global best scheme developed for the <#5776#>FAP<#5776#> <#5777#>PSO<#5777#> is more finely grained than the other with regard to what the scheme uses to build a gbest. Algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbestcells#5778><tex2html_cr_mark></A> uses interference information of cells to build a gbest. Algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbesttrx#5779><tex2html_cr_mark></A> uses the interference generated by each transceiver installed at a cell to build a gbest. Since each cell has transceivers, the second algorithm is therefore more finer grained than algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbestcells#5780><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

Each algorithm will now be discussed since the difference between them is subtle. Algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbestcells#5800><tex2html_cr_mark></A> was the first global best building scheme which was developed and is discussed first. The algorithm starts off in line 1 by iterating through all the particles in the swarm. For each particle the algorithm enters another loop as can be observed in line 2 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbestcells#5801><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The second loop of the algorithm iterates through all the cells in the frequency plan that represent a position of the particle. Once the algorithm has obtained a cell it looks for the same cell in the gbest frequency plan. Since the algorithm now has the current cell and the gbest cell it is able to compare the two cells based on the interference their respective transceivers generate.

<P>
The interference generated by the cell is retrieved and then compared as can be observed to occur in line 6. If the current cell has a lower interference (cost) value than the same cell in the global best plan, then the algorithm replaces the cell in the global best with the current cell.

<P>
The second algorithm is the finer grained algorithm and was developed because, after analysing the algorithm using cells, it was concluded that it is possible that a single bad frequency allocation to a transceiver within a cell can overshadow other potentially good frequency allocations to other cells within the cell.

<P>
Algorithms~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbestcells#5802><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbesttrx#5803><tex2html_cr_mark></A> have very similar flow, except that the second algorithm has an extra for-loop. In line 3 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbesttrx#5804><tex2html_cr_mark></A> a third for-loop is started, which iterates through all the transceivers a particular cell <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15683#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# has installed. The algorithm then obtains the frequency allocated to the same transceiver in the global best frequency plan.

<P>
Once both transceivers have been obtained, the algorithm determines the interference (cost) their respective frequency allocations generated. Using the cost values the algorithm determines whether the current transceiver frequency allocation generates less interference than the frequency allocated to the same transceiver in the global best frequency plan.

<P>
If the current transceiver frequency generates less interference, the algorithm then proceeds to replace the transceiver frequency in the global best with the current transceiver frequency. Thus it can be seen that algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:gbesttrx#5805><tex2html_cr_mark></A> utilises individual transceivers to build a global best.

<P>
Initially when the <#5806#>FAP<#5806#> <#5807#>PSO<#5807#> algorithm was tested using both of these global best schemes, the <#5808#>PSO<#5808#> did not produce noticeably better results. This was due to the algorithm at each iteration discarding the interference or cost information calculated in that iteration and making it zero. Making the cost values zero does initially seem correct, but effectively what is happening is that the algorithm is discarding knowledge gained by that iteration.

<P>
To enable this information to direct the swarm a bit more, the <#5809#>FAP<#5809#> <#5810#>PSO<#5810#> algorithm was modified to not reset the interference values for every transceiver and cell to 0. Instead, the interference values for an iteration are now added to the previous iteration interference values stored by the cell and transceiver. 

<P>
By letting interference values compound after each iteration the <#5811#>PSO<#5811#> becomes much more aggressive. This is because as the interference compounds bad decisions made by the swarm for a particular particle become progressively worse as the swarm progresses through more iterations.

<P>
With compounding interference values the <#5812#>FAP<#5812#> <#5813#>PSO<#5813#> was able to produce much better positions and had lower total interference (cost) than all previously generated positions by previous <#5814#>FAP<#5814#> <#5815#>PSO<#5815#> algorithms. 

<P>
The <#5816#>FAP<#5816#> <#5817#>PSO<#5817#> algorithm is able to produce better results by allowing particles to keep a history of their previous movements. This is covered in the next section.
