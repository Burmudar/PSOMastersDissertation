Crossover Operator
</H3>
The crossover operator is the first operator applied to the population in the reproduction phase. The crossover operates exclusively on the chromosomes in the mating pool. Crossover works by interchanging genes from one or more parent chromosomes. The parent chromosomes are selected with a probability from the mating pool to produce a single chromosome known as the offspring [#FamilyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#HumanPassiveGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CoactiveFuzzyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The probability is known as the <I>crossover probability</I> and is problem dependent[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By defining a high crossver probability the good genes that form the current population are retained in the next population[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With good genes being retained more historical information is passed onto the next generation's population[#FamilyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
There are a variety of ways in which genes are interchanged between chromosomes in the crossover operation i.e. fixed point crossover, two point crossover, uniform crossover and gaussian crossover[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. All of these crossovers operate on the premise that a byte representation is used for the chromosomes. 

<P>
With the byte representation, each chromosome is a byte. Each byte is made up of sequence of bits. As discussed previously each chromosome is made out of genes and therefore each bit is a gene[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Fixed point crossover operates on binary parents whereby a point is selected in one parent and then all other bits are replaced by the other parents' bits [#HumanPassiveGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Two point crossover generates two random indices which dictate a certain segment in the one parent to be interchanged with the other parent [#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Where a segment consists of a subset of genes from the chromosome. 

<P>
The uniform crossover is the most basic of all crossovers since it randomly selects bits from one parent to be replaced by another parent's bits[#ParallelGASA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GeostatisticalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Finally, the Gaussian crossover also uses the byte representation. The Gaussian crossover interchanges bits between parents based on a Gaussian distribution [#ParallelGASA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GeostatisticalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Depending on the state of the algorithm, crossover operators can also be interchanged or even paired if the algorithm needs better search performance for large or small solution spaces [#HetergeneousGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ParallelGASA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Caution should be exercised by the crossover operator when selecting chromosomes for reproduction. It is possible for the operator to select the same chromosome twice to be the parent of a single offspring[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The operator is also at risk of selecting the same chromosome multiple times for reproduction[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The opertator must therefore incorporate a test to detect unenecessary repeated usage of a chromosome[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Finally, it is important to note that there exist strategies for both Gaussian crossover and mutation based operators for use with continuous-valued representations[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
