The Siemens3 problem describes a network based on <#2054#>gsm<#2054#>900. This network has been allocated a continuous set of frequencies <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math68#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15090#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. Thus the network has 55 frequencies, which can be allocated to transceivers in its network.

<P>
The problem defines the network as consisting of 366 sites and 894 cells. On average each cell has 1.82 transceivers that need to be allocated a frequency to handle communication.
