In this chapter the results produced by the algorithm discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#6651><tex2html_cr_mark></A> were presented. The FAP PSO algorithm was applied to four COST 259 benchmarks namely Siemens1, Siemens2, Siemens3 and Siemens4. These four benchmarks were discussed in detail in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:fap#6652><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. For each of the benchmarks, 12 different variants of the FAP PSO algorithm were tested. Each variant used a different velocity function, global best selection scheme or population size. The chapter concluded with critical analyses of each of the different algorithms developed in this study to enable the PSO to operate in the FAP space.
