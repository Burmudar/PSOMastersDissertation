Research Objective</A>
</H1>
As stated in the introduction, the objective of this research was to determine whether it is viable and possible to apply a modern-day swarm-based algorithm to the frequency assignment problem. 

<P>
The question therefore is whether this research objective was achieved. The answer is yes. An algorithm based on the PSO algorithm was presented that operated on the frequency assignment problem. The only part still left is the viability of applying this algorithm to modern cellular networks.

<P>
Before the viability analysis is presented, the chapter breakdown in the introduction is revisited in the next section.
