--- The <#3078#>GA<#3078#> continually operates on a set population that is randomly initialised at the beginning of the algorithm. It therefore only has this set of generated genes in the initialised population to therefore evolve successive populations.
If one disregards mutation, the <#3079#>GA<#3079#> is a process by which the optimal combinations of the starting genes are found. Thus, the <#3080#>GA<#3080#> purifies the starting population genes in an attempt to find those individual genes, which if combined into a single individual, will produce an optimal individual, i.e. solution. Therefore the <#3081#>GA<#3081#> is very reliant on the quality of the random generator used. The probability of the algorithm finding a particular desirable gene that is exhibited by the starting population is directly related to the random number generator used to initialise the population.
