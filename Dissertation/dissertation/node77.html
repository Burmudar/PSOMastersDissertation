Flow of the algorithm</A>
</H2>
In this section the general flow of the <#2591#>TS<#2591#> algorithm is described using algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:TS#2592><tex2html_cr_mark></A> as a reference point.

<P>
Before the algorithm can actually start searching, it first needs to initialise various parameters. These parameters include, but are not limited to, the tabu list size, the aspiration criterion and the starting solution. The initialisation can be observed to occur from lines 1 - 2.

<P>
Once all the various parameters that are needed by the algorithm have been initialised, the algorithm is ready to enter the actual search phase, which ranges from lines 3 -- 21. 

<P>
The search phase starts off by first generating possible solutions that neighbour the current solution <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15118#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# as can be observed in line 4. Generating neighbouring solutions are a critical process in the <#2615#>TS<#2615#> algorithm as tehy are the means by which the algorithm is able to move from one possible solution to the next in the search space.

<P>
After all the solutions that neighbour the current possible solution have been generated, the algorithm needs to decide which of the possible neighbours is the most rewarding. The algorithm therefore determines the fitness of each neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15120#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# by applying a fitness function <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15122#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. 

<P>
Once all the neighbours have been evaluated, the algorithm selects the best neighbour that not only has the best fitness out of all the generated neighbours, but also has a better fitness than the current solution held by the algorithm. The best neighbour selection can be seen to occur in line 6.

<P>
The algorithm has now determined a possible neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15124#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# to move towards. Before moving on to the next iteration, it first needs to perform a series of checks that will aid it in the search process.

<P>
The first check that needs to be performed is whether the neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15126#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is in the tabu list and this occurs in line 7. 

<P>
If the neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15128#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is in the tabu list, then another check is performed where the aspiration criterion is calculated as can be seen in lines 8 -- 10. The aspiration criterion determines whether the algorithm can make neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15130#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# its current solution once more even though it is tabu. 

<P>
If the aspiration criterion has been met, the algorithm makes neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15132#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# its current solution <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15134#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. 

<P>
In the algorithm, if a neighbour <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15136#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is found not to be in the tabu list, the algorithm then adds the currently held solution <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15138#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# to the tabu list. The current solution is added to prohibit future movements to the same solution in an attempt to avoid cycling of solutions. After <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15140#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# has been added to the tabu list, the algorithm makes <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15142#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# the current solution <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15144#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. This process can be observed from lines 12 -- 14.

<P>
Before the algorithm continues to the next iteration, it performs one last final check. The purpose of this check is to determine whether the algorithm is repeating solutions. As can be observed from lines 15 -- 19, the algorithm calculates whether the new selected solution has been repeated for a certain number of iterations. 

<P>
If the solution has indeed been repeated for a predetermined number of iterations, the algorithm activates its diversification strategy or intensifies its search.

The section that follows presents an overview of the <#2616#>TS<#2616#> being applied to the <#2617#>FAP<#2617#>.
