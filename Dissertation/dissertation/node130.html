Food source representation</A>
</H4>
--- Each food source can either represent a frequency plan or it can be a particular cell and a collective of food sources represents a frequency plan. If each food source is a frequency plan the algorithm will require a fair amount of memory, since as onlooker bees select it, they will start searching for neighbouring solutions. These neighbouring solutions are <I>also</I> frequency plans. However, if each food source is a cell, this would require less memory. The problem with the latter approach is that the bees would then single out one cell as the optimum, since they do not know that all food sources collectively represent a plan and each cell is actually unique.
