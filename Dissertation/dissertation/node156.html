Introduction</A>
</H1>
In the previous chapter the FAP PSO algorithm was discussed. This algorithm was developed by modifying the standard PSO algorithm to operate on the FS-FAP. Thus far, no other PSO algorithms have been attempted on the FS-FAP. The only PSO algorithm that has been attempted in the FAP domain was discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:swarm#6543><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and was not relevant to the study in this dissertation, as the PSO was applied to an entirely different FAP variant (MS-FAP). The PSO on the MS-FAP was not relevant because the performance measures and what the algorithms optimise differ.

<P>
With the FS-FAP, the main performance measurement is interference and the PSO aims to allocate frequencies in an optimal way to internally produce a frequency plan. On the other hand, the MS-FAP is concerned with the span of frequencies used and the performance measurement is based on the calls dropped. The main purpose of the PSO in the MS-FAP is to minimise the span of frequencies used and keep the number of dropped calls to a minimum.

<P>
In the previous chapter all the modifications that were made to the standard PSO were discussed. The modifications were made to enable to PSO to operate on the FAP. Two velocity methods were developed and in addition to the standard global best selection scheme, two additional global best selection schemes were put forward. The algorithm presented was benchmarked against the Siemens instances of the COST 259 benchmark.

<P>
In this chapter the results are given of applying the FAP PSO algorithm with its different velocity methods as well as different global selection schemes. This is followed by how the different velocity methods affected the PSO performance as well as how the global selection schemes affected the final produces results.
