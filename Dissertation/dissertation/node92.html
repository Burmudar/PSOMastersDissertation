Neighbourhood generation</A>
</H4>
--- The <#2843#>SA<#2843#> algorithm, as with the <#2844#>TS<#2844#> algorithm, has no set process that defines how neighbours should be generated. As discussed, neighbourhood generation is the primary means by which the <#2845#>SA<#2845#> algorithm moves about the search space in search of an optimal solution. Therefore applying the <#2846#>SA<#2846#> algorithm would require a custom neighbourhood generation scheme. A desireble neighbourhood generation scheme would be one that keeps track of where the algorithm has been previously. By keeping history, the algorithm will be able to avoid previously explored areas in the search space.
