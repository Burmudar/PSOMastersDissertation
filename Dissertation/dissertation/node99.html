Mutation Operator</A>
</H3>
The mutation operator is a probabilistic operator and is applied to individials in the offspring population with a probability referred to as the mutation rate[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The purpose of the mutation operator is to increase the diversity of the genes of a individual chromosomes[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By introducing new genes into an individual the diversity of the populations characteristics are increased[#CoactiveFuzzyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AcceleratingGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The mutation operator has no previous information on the chromosome it is mutating; thus it is entirely possible that the mutation may modify the chromosome for the worse [#AcceleratingGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A worse solution might lead the algorithm out of local optima or lead it down a new path to find the global optima, but this is not always the case [#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FamilyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It is for this reason that it is recommended that the mutation rate be set to a low value to ensure good solutions are not distored too much[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In a survey done by Engelbrecht[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] another mutation operator is discussed. Instead of mutating a small part of randomly selected chromosomes, this operator generates new offspring to be inserted back into the population. The operator randomly generates a new chromosome and then uses any of the previously discussed crossover operators (see page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:crossover#2978><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>).

<P>
The mutation operator is not always a basic random replacement of genes operation. In research done by Il-kwon Jeong and Ju-jang Lee[#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], a mutation operator is presented that uses the <#2980#>SA<#2980#> algorithm to determine the genes that need to be replaced. The <#2981#>SA<#2981#> mutation operator generates a new chromosome from which genes are used to replace in the chromosome being mutated [#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Addition mutation operators are discussed in Engelbrecht[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
