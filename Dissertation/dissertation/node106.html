Mutation</A>

--- Mutation is a means by which more diversity is introduced into the chromosomes of the invididuals.  As discussed, the mutation operator introduces new genes to existing chromosome which can lead to an excellent solution being distorted and becoming one of the worst solutions. With regard to the <#3088#>FAP<#3088#>, the low probability of mutation is not desirable, as the <#3089#>FAP<#3089#> search space is huge and therefore requires constant diversity to be introduced to accurately explore it. A possible good mutation would be one that is slightly more intelligent than the standard mutation operator, which just randomly modifies a selected individual. An intelligent mutation would be one that takes into account the recent history of the individual as well as the history of the population and, based on the collective knowledge alters or <I>mutates</I> a particular individual. Each chromosome would therefore be required to keep history of changes made to itself, to allow the mutation operator to take it into account. Another means of applying the mutation operator is to set the mutation rate proprtional to an individuals fitness. By modifying the mutation rate in this manner, mutating good individuals can be avoided.
