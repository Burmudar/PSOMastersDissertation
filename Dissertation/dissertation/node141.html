PSO on the FAP

The <#4598#>PSO<#4598#> algorithm is also a relatively new algorithm and has been applied to only a handful of NP-Complete problems, including the <#4599#>FAP<#4599#>. In this dissertation the <#4600#>PSO<#4600#> algorithm will be utilized on the <#4601#>FS-FAP<#4601#> to try and produce optimal solutions. 

<P>
Only two groups have conducted research where the <#4602#>PSO<#4602#> has been applied to the <#4603#>FAP<#4603#> to produce a near optimal solution. The research concentrated on the <#4604#>MS-FAP<#4604#> variant of the <#4605#>FAP<#4605#>, and so the aim of their algorithm was to reduce the span of frequencies used. The problem this dissertation is concerned with is the <#4606#>FS-FAP<#4606#> where the amount of interference generated needs to be minimised. 

<P>
To date, no <#4607#>PSO<#4607#> algorithm has been designed to operate on the <#4608#>FS-FAP<#4608#> variant. Therefore, the interest in the research mentioned above is more to do with how the authors went about encoding a particular frequency plan as a position for a particle, than with the actual optimisation procedure.

<P>
In the research presented by Elkamchouchi et al.[#EgyptFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] a <#4610#>PSO<#4610#> algorithm is applied to produce optimal solutions for the <#4611#>MS-FAP<#4611#>. The way the authors went about assigning frequencies in their algorithm is known as <#4612#>FEA<#4612#>.
This method works by first generating a list of calls, called a <I>call list</I>, denoting calls that occur in the system[#EgyptFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The <#4615#>FEA<#4615#> method then iterates over the calls in the list and assigns the lowest possible frequencies to the calls without violating interference constraints[#EgyptFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The authors note that the specific frequency that is assigned to a particular call depends heavily on the order the calls are in the list[#EgyptFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Because of the success of the <#4618#>PSO<#4618#> on the <#4619#>MS-FAP<#4619#>, for this dissertation the <#4620#>PSO<#4620#> algorithm was selected as the primary means by which to address the <#4621#>FAP<#4621#>.

<P>
The algorithm also makes extensive use of knowledge gained by the various particles as they search the problem space. Depending on the values used for <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15598#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# and <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15600#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#, a particle does not only keep personal history (with pbest), but the swarm as a whole keeps a history of the best particle (neighbourhood best). Thus with regard to <#4622#>FAP<#4622#>, it is possible that even though a particle might be in an overall bad position, it might have some small bit of good knowledge being overshadowed by bad knowledge. Through the extensive use of historical knowledge good information is more likely to be shared or kept slightly longer in the algorithms collective knowledge.

<P>
For this research the <#4623#>PSO<#4623#> was applied to the <#4624#>FS-FAP<#4624#> on the <#4625#>COST<#4625#> 259 benchmark problems. The approach by the authors in the above literature could not be used. <#4626#>FS-FAP<#4626#> is concerned with interference generated and there are some constraints which cannot be broken which are mentioned in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:COST259#4627><tex2html_cr_mark></A> page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:COST259#4628><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>. In contrast with <#4629#>MS-FAP<#4629#>, the performance measure is explicitly the number of constraints violated not interference.

<P>
