The Fitness Function</A>
</H1>
The fitness function rates the desirability of a particular particle's position in the problem space.

<P>
As discussed in the previous section, the COST 259 benchmark problems provide an interference matrix that lists the total amount of interference that occurs when a pair of cells interfere. As outlined in the structure definition (see section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:Interference#5528><tex2html_cr_mark></A>) each entry in the interference matrix defines a pair of cells that are said to interfere, along with two additional values. The first value is referred to as co-channel interference and is the total amount of interference that will occur on the communication link when the allocated frequency of one transceiver is equal to a transceiver in the other cell that is listed in the interference matrix. 

<P>
The second value is called adjacent channel interference and it is the total amount of interference that will occur on the communication link when the allocated frequency of a transceiver in one cell differs by 1 from another frequency allocated to the transceiver from the other cell that is listed in the interference matrix.

<P>
Particles move towards other particles because the other particles have indicated (through information sharing) that the positions they occupy are very lucrative and thus they have found potentially good solutions. The only way particles can know the lucrativeness of the position they occupy is if the position is evaluated with a fitness function. Thus the lucrativeness of a position is actually the fitness value obtained from the fitness function. 

<P>
Since a particle position is defined as a frequency plan, a procedure is needed that calculates the fitness of a frequency plan. With the <#5529#>FS-FAP<#5529#> the primary concern is to keep interference to a minimum. Therefore in the <#5530#>PSO<#5530#> that was developed the fitness value is the total amount of interference generated by all the cells with their allocated frequencies. 

<P>
The evaluation procedure goes through each pair of cells defined in the interference matrix where it looks up both cells in the frequency plan. The second cell is said to interfere with the first cell. Therefore each transceiver in the first cell is checked against all the transceivers of the other cell. Depending on whether the frequencies differ from each other, the fitness procedure adds either co-channel or the adjacent channel interference to a summing variable. This procedure is mathematically defined in chapter 3 (see page <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#E:costFunction#5531><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A> for the formal equation) and algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:fapcost#5532><tex2html_cr_mark></A> is the pseudocode of the implement equation used by the <#5533#>PSO<#5533#> .

<P>
As can be seen in algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:fapcost#5546><tex2html_cr_mark></A> not all interference values are added to the total amount of interference variable. The COST 259 benchmarks define a minimum tolerable interference variable. This means that if a given interference value is either equal to or less than this defined value the interference generated is negligible and can be disregarded as it will not have a noticeable impact on the communication link.

<P>
In the next section a description is given of how particles are moved from one iteration to the next using frequency plans as positions in the solution space.
