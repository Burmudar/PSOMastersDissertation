\chapter<<1499>>The Frequency Assignment Problem<<1499>>
\label<<1500>>chpt:fap<<1500>>
\section<<1501>>Introduction<<1501>>
The \gls<<1502>>FAP<<1502>>\begin<<1646>>tex2html_deferred<<1646>>\footnote<<1625>>Also known as \gls<<1503>>AFP<<1503>> or \gls<<1504>>CAP<<1504>>\cite<<1505>>ACOvsEA<<1505>><<1625>>\end<<1647>>tex2html_deferred<<1647>> is a generalisation of the graph-colouring problem and is consequently an NP-Complete problem\cite<<1506>>FAPRAMColouring<<1506>>. The \gls<<1507>>FAP<<1507>> is an NP-Complete problem due to fact that only a finite number of frequencies can be assigned to \glspl<<1508>>TRX<<1508>>, where the number of transceivers to be assigned frequencies greatly outweighs the number of available frequencies\cite<<1509>>FAPRAMColouring<<1509>>. A more thorough definition of what it means for a problem to be NP-Complete is given in section~\ref<<1510>>sec:NPComplete<<1510>>.

In wireless communication a huge concern is interference which occurs when frequencies used for communication are close to each other in the frequency spectrum\cite<<1511>>Karen2004<<1511>>. Interference and its effects is discussed in detail in section~\ref<<1512>>sec:Interference<<1512>>. Essentially for the \gls<<1513>>FAP<<1513>> the primary concern is to develop an approximate plan on assigning frequencies in such a way that interference is kept to a minimum. 
\begin<<1650>>tex2html_deferred<<1650>>\par\end<<1651>>tex2html_deferred<<1651>>
Using exact algorithms to find a solution is not practical since the time to find a solution is polynomial. Generally metaheuristic algorithms are used to find optimal solutions to NP-Complete problems\cite<<1514>>ACOvsEA<<1514>>. In the chapter~\ref<<1515>>chpt:heuristic<<1515>>, a discussion is presented on algorithms that are used to find solutions to NP-Complete problems. 
\begin<<1652>>tex2html_deferred<<1652>>\par\end<<1653>>tex2html_deferred<<1653>>
As discussed in chapter~\ref<<1516>>chpt:celltech<<1516>> network operators are licensed a range of frequencies from the available spectrum. A licensed piece of spectrum contains a series of consecutive frequencies as well as gaps. Gap frequencies are barred from being used by any device within the network as they may have already been allocated to another operator for use \cite<<1517>>FAPInCell<<1517>>. By barring frequencies, a scenario is avoided where the different networks' equipment interferes with their respective operations\cite<<1518>>FAPInCell<<1518>>.
\begin<<1654>>tex2html_deferred<<1654>>\par\end<<1655>>tex2html_deferred<<1655>>
Due to the whole spectrum not being available to network operators and only a subset being available for commercial communication as per the frequencies allocated to them, networks opt to reuse their frequencies\cite<<1519>>FAPInCell<<1519>>. The networks do this to maximise the use of their allocated frequencies and to minimise their licensing fees, since if the network needs more frequencies, they need to be licensed\cite<<1520>>FAPRAMColouring<<1520>>.
\begin<<1656>>tex2html_deferred<<1656>>\par\end<<1657>>tex2html_deferred<<1657>>
It is not always possible to simply allocate more frequencies to a network even if the network pays the associated fees. The whole commercial spectrum may already have been licensed to various entities. Hence, licensed frequencies are a very valuable and scarce commodity \cite<<1521>>FAPRAMColouring,FAPInCell<<1521>>.
\begin<<1658>>tex2html_deferred<<1658>>\par\end<<1659>>tex2html_deferred<<1659>>
The chapter is organised as follows. The first section the follows provides a discussion on NP-Complete problems. In section~\ref<<1522>>sec:chm<<1522>> constraint handling mechanisms are presented. Section~\ref<<1523>>sec:FreqAssignmentTypes<<1523>> presents an overview of different methods for allocated frequencies. Interference is discussed in depth in section~\ref<<1524>>sec:Interference<<1524>>. After the interference discussion a section is presented on the different types of frequencies assignment problems in section~\ref<<1525>>sec:FAPVariants<<1525>>. A mathematical formulation of the fixed spectrum frequency assignment problem is presented in section~\ref<<1526>>sec:FAPMathDef<<1526>>. Section~\ref<<1527>>sec:FAPBenchmarks<<1527>> provides an overview of the different benchmarks used to evaluate frequency assignment problems. After the discussion on the different benchmarks that are available in the domain a section on the where the FAP is encountered in the industrial domain is presented. 
\begin<<1660>>tex2html_deferred<<1660>>\par\end<<1661>>tex2html_deferred<<1661>>
This chapter concluded with a section that summarises the contents presented. In the next section an overview of what it means when a problem is NP-Complete is given.
\begin<<1662>>tex2html_deferred<<1662>>\par\end<<1663>>tex2html_deferred<<1663>>
\section<<1528>>NP-Complete<<1528>>
\label<<1529>>sec:NPComplete<<1529>>
The term NP stems from the field known as complexity analysis. Algorithms are typically measured for their worst running time using \begin<<1634>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1634>>$O(n)$\end<<1635>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1635>>\space notation. The field of complexity analysis is more interested in measuring complexity of a problem than the running time of an algorithm\cite<<1530>>AIModernApproach<<1530>>.
\begin<<1664>>tex2html_deferred<<1664>>\par\end<<1665>>tex2html_deferred<<1665>>
The field of complexity analysis makes a keen distinction between problems that can be solved by algorithms in polynomial time and problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time using any available algorithm\cite<<1531>>AIModernApproach<<1531>>. An algorithm is said to be of polynomial time if the number of steps it needs to perform to solve the problem is given by \begin<<1636>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1636>>$O(n^k)$\end<<1637>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1637>>\space where \begin<<1638>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1638>>$k$\end<<1639>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1639>>\space is a nonnegative integer and \begin<<1640>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1640>>$n$\end<<1641>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1641>>\space refers to the complexity of the input\cite<<1532>>AIModernApproach<<1532>>.
\begin<<1666>>tex2html_deferred<<1666>>\par\end<<1667>>tex2html_deferred<<1667>>
A distinction needs to be made between \emph<<1533>>finding<<1533>> a possible solution and determining whether a result is a valid solution to an NP problem\cite<<1534>>AIModernApproach<<1534>>. Verifying whether some result is indeed a solution to an NP problem is a quick operation\cite<<1535>>AIModernApproach<<1535>>. Finding a solution through the use of an algorithm is what polynomial time refers to.
\begin<<1668>>tex2html_deferred<<1668>>\par\end<<1669>>tex2html_deferred<<1669>>
Algorithms that are able to solve problems in polynomial time have worst case running times of \begin<<1642>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1642>>$O(n),O(\log n)$\end<<1643>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1643>>\space and \begin<<1644>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1644>>$O(n^2)$\end<<1645>>tex2html_wrap_inline<<1645>>\cite<<1536>>AIModernApproach<<1536>>. These classes of problems are easy to solve using modern algorithms available today. Problems that can be solved with these kind of running times are classified as being in the P range of complexity problems\cite<<1537>>AIModernApproach<<1537>>.
\begin<<1670>>tex2html_deferred<<1670>>\par\end<<1671>>tex2html_deferred<<1671>>
Another range of problems consists mostly of problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time\cite<<1538>>AIModernApproach<<1538>>. Hence, if an algorithm were to try each and every possible solution, it would take an arbitrarily long time, which cannot be determined, which is why these problems also have the characteristic of being non-deterministic\cite<<1539>>AIModernApproach<<1539>>. Problems in this range are referred to as being in the NP range of complexity problems\cite<<1540>>AIModernApproach<<1540>>.
\begin<<1672>>tex2html_deferred<<1672>>\par\end<<1673>>tex2html_deferred<<1673>>
There is another range of NP problems that are a subset of NP problems, which are referred to as the ``most extreme'' problems within NP\@.  These problems are collectively known as NP-Complete problems and are the most difficult problems to determine feasible solutions for in the NP problem range\cite<<1541>>AIModernApproach<<1541>>. The \gls<<1542>>FAP<<1542>> is one such problem \cite<<1543>>AndreasPaper,FixedFAPPSO<<1543>>.
\begin<<1674>>tex2html_deferred<<1674>>\par\end<<1675>>tex2html_deferred<<1675>>
\section<<1544>>Constraint Handling mechanisms<<1544>>
\label<<1545>>sec:chm<<1545>>
Not only is the \gls<<1546>>FAP<<1546>> an NP-Complete problem but it is also a constraint problem. Constraint problem restrict the search space of possible solutions with boundaries. These boundaries are reffered to as constraints. The \gls<<1547>>FAP<<1547>> domain has specific constraints defined for each of the different individual problems. Before the various ways in which frequencies can be allocated is discussed a brief discussion needs to be presented on constraint handling mechanisms.
\begin<<1676>>tex2html_deferred<<1676>>\par\end<<1677>>tex2html_deferred<<1677>>
Constraints define the boundaries of the search space. Solutions found to be violating the constraints are considered to be outside of the search space. Various methods exist how to treat solutions found to be outside of the defined search space. These methods are known to be \emph<<1548>>constraint handling mechanisms<<1548>> and are discussed below.
\begin<<1678>>tex2html_deferred<<1678>>\par\end<<1679>>tex2html_deferred<<1679>>
In research done by Engelbrecht\cite<<1549>>CompuIntelligenceIntro<<1549>> the following constraint handling mechanisms are defined.
\begin<<1550>>itemize<<1550>>
\item<<1626>>\textbf<<1551>>Reject infeasible solutions<<1551>><<1626>> --- Solutions that violate the defined constraints are not even considered and rejected.
\item<<1627>>\textbf<<1552>>Penalty function methods<<1552>><<1627>> --- Modifies the objective function to add a penalty that is enforced if a solution violates constraints. By adding a penalty the infeasible solutions are discouraged.
\item<<1628>>\textbf<<1553>>Convert the constrained problem to an unconstrained problem<<1553>><<1628>> --- By solving the unconstrained problem better solutions can be found although not guaranteed.
\item<<1629>>\textbf<<1554>>Preserving feasibility methods<<1554>><<1629>> --- Candidate solutions are initialised in the search space and satisfy all constraints. These solutions are continuously moved or transformed with specialised operators who ensure that the solutions continue to satisfy all the constraints. The operators ensure that all solutions stay within the bounded search space.
\item<<1630>>\textbf<<1555>>Pareto ranking methods<<1555>><<1630>> --- Solutions are ranked based on the severity of their constraint violations.
\item<<1631>>\textbf<<1556>>Repair methods<<1556>><<1631>> --- Operators are used to transform solutions that violate constraints to solutions that adhere to all the constraints and are thus feasible solutions.
\end<<1557>>itemize<<1557>>
\begin<<1680>>tex2html_deferred<<1680>>\par\end<<1681>>tex2html_deferred<<1681>>
Constraint handling methods need to be used when solving constrained problems like the \gls<<1558>>FAP<<1558>>. Without these methods, the search for solutions is undirected and solutions that cannot be used are presented as most optimal. Reference to these methods will be made where applicable.
\begin<<1682>>tex2html_deferred<<1682>>\par\end<<1683>>tex2html_deferred<<1683>>
In the next section, two methods are discussed that define how frequencies are allocated.
\section<<1559>>Frequency Allocation Types<<1559>>
\label<<1560>>sec:FreqAssignmentTypes<<1560>>
In this section the different methods used to allocate frequencies to cells in a cellular network are discussed. Furthermore the method that relates to the specific \gls<<1561>>FAP<<1561>> variant in this dissertation is described.
\begin<<1684>>tex2html_deferred<<1684>>\par\end<<1685>>tex2html_deferred<<1685>>
Within the \gls<<1562>>FAP<<1562>> domain there are different types of \gls<<1563>>FAP<<1563>>, which have emerged over the years as the domain of wireless communications matured and technological requirements changed. These \gls<<1564>>FAP<<1564>> variants are discussed in section~\ref<<1565>>sec:FAPVariants<<1565>>.
\begin<<1686>>tex2html_deferred<<1686>>\par\end<<1687>>tex2html_deferred<<1687>>
There are a variety of \gls<<1566>>FAP<<1566>>s in the wireless communication domain but each individual problem can be classified into one of the following two categories based on the way frequencies are assigned to cells:
\begin<<1567>>itemize<<1567>>
  \item \emph<<1632>>\gls<<1568>>FFA<<1568>><<1632>> is where frequencies assigned to cells are static; therefore they cannot be changed until a new assignment plan is calculated\cite<<1569>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1569>>.
\item \emph<<1633>>\gls<<1570>>DFA<<1570>><<1633>> is the process of allocating frequencies to cells as required to meet the current traffic demand imposed on them by clients\cite<<1571>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1571>>. 
\end<<1572>>itemize<<1572>>
\begin<<1688>>tex2html_deferred<<1688>>\par\end<<1689>>tex2html_deferred<<1689>>
\subsection<<1573>>Fixed Frequency/Channel Assignment<<1573>>
\gls<<1574>>FFA<<1574>> is the process of permanently assigning frequencies to cells \cite<<1575>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1575>>. The frequencies assigned are fixed and cannot be changed immediately while the network is active, since the frequencies assigned to the cell form part of a delicate frequency plan designed to keep interference on communication links to a minimum\cite<<1576>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1576>>. 
\begin<<1690>>tex2html_deferred<<1690>>\par\end<<1691>>tex2html_deferred<<1691>>
When the channel used by a particular cell for communication is suddenly changed, the cell might start interfering with neighbouring cells' communication links. This interference is caused because the assigned frequencies of the neighbouring cells are close to each other on the frequency spectrum. Hence, if the cell is sectored (refer to section~\ref<<1577>>def:cellsector<<1577>> in chapter two for a discussion on cell sectorisation) it can interfere with a minimum of three and up to a maximum of six neighbouring cells\cite<<1578>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1578>>.
\begin<<1692>>tex2html_deferred<<1692>>\par\end<<1693>>tex2html_deferred<<1693>>
When an \gls<<1579>>FFA<<1579>> plan is created, cells are assigned frequencies based on the estimated traffic that cell will be expected to handle during peak network usage. \gls<<1580>>FFA<<1580>> is ideally suited for macro cellular networks since the nature of the traffic encountered in such networks has the characteristic of being homogeneous, stationary and predictable \cite<<1581>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1581>>. Cellular networks can be classified as being in the macro cellular group of wireless networks.
\begin<<1694>>tex2html_deferred<<1694>>\par\end<<1695>>tex2html_deferred<<1695>>
With \gls<<1582>>FFA<<1582>>, networks are able to permanently allocate a certain subset of frequencies to cells since the nature of the traffic on their network allows them to predict with reasonable certainty the call blocking probability \cite<<1583>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1583>>. A call is blocked on the network when a cell has no available frequencies to use when establishing a communication link \cite<<1584>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1584>>.
\begin<<1696>>tex2html_deferred<<1696>>\par\end<<1697>>tex2html_deferred<<1697>>
In situations where the nature of the traffic is neither homogeneous nor stationary, using the \gls<<1585>>FFA<<1585>> allocation scheme is not feasible as its use of available frequencies is grossly inefficient \cite<<1586>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1586>>.
\begin<<1698>>tex2html_deferred<<1698>>\par\end<<1699>>tex2html_deferred<<1699>>
A problem that occurs with \gls<<1587>>FFA<<1587>> when all assigned frequencies are in use is that any new call or call handed over will be blocked\cite<<1588>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1588>>. The call will be blocked even if adjacent cells have suitable capacity to handle the call\cite<<1589>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1589>>.
\begin<<1700>>tex2html_deferred<<1700>>\par\end<<1701>>tex2html_deferred<<1701>>
\subsection<<1590>>Dynamic Frequency/Channel Assignment<<1590>>
\gls<<1591>>DFA<<1591>> is a channel allocation scheme where frequencies assigned to cells are not permanent but rather assigned to cells as the need arises\cite<<1592>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1592>>. Therefore all the frequencies licensed by a particular network are available to each and every cell to establish a communication link as long as the channel does not violate the co-channel reuse constraint \cite<<1593>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1593>>. 
\begin<<1702>>tex2html_deferred<<1702>>\par\end<<1703>>tex2html_deferred<<1703>>
The co-channel reuse constraint must be adhered to otherwise the amount of interference occurring on the communication link will be too much\cite<<1594>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication<<1594>>. This constraint forms part of the electromagnetic constraints, which are described in section~\ref<<1595>>sec:Interference<<1595>>.
\begin<<1704>>tex2html_deferred<<1704>>\par\end<<1705>>tex2html_deferred<<1705>>
The \gls<<1596>>DFA<<1596>> allocation scheme is ideally suited for micro cellular wireless networks. The traffic on these networks have the characteristic of being immensely unpredictable as traffic demand varies constantly\cite<<1597>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication,MobileWirelessCommunications<<1597>>.
\begin<<1706>>tex2html_deferred<<1706>>\par\end<<1707>>tex2html_deferred<<1707>>
As the name indicates, micro cellular wireless networks have much smaller cell sizes than macro cellular networks. Thus a cell in a micro cellular network must handle a lot more handover requests than a cell in a macro cellular network, since an \gls<<1598>>MS<<1598>> with an active connection is much more likely to move out of the coverage area of a micro cell than a macro cell \cite<<1599>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications<<1599>>.
\begin<<1708>>tex2html_deferred<<1708>>\par\end<<1709>>tex2html_deferred<<1709>>
Since a micro cellular network has increased handover requests between cells compared with a macro cellular network, a \gls<<1600>>DFA<<1600>> scheme must rapidly allocate frequencies to requesting cells that must handle the handovers\cite<<1601>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications<<1601>>.
\begin<<1710>>tex2html_deferred<<1710>>\par\end<<1711>>tex2html_deferred<<1711>>
\gls<<1602>>DFA<<1602>> is much more efficient than \gls<<1603>>FFA<<1603>> when the amount of mobile traffic on the network is relatively low\cite<<1604>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications<<1604>>. On the other hand, when the network is under heavy mobile traffic load, the \gls<<1605>>FFA<<1605>> scheme outperforms the \gls<<1606>>DFA<<1606>> scheme\cite<<1607>>WirelessCommunications<<1607>>. The \gls<<1608>>DFA<<1608>> shceme is outperformed because it allocates frequencies to cells in an inefficient arrangement that might affect the amount of interference encountered on the network\cite<<1609>>MobileWirelessCommunications<<1609>>.
\begin<<1712>>tex2html_deferred<<1712>>\par\end<<1713>>tex2html_deferred<<1713>>
Finally \gls<<1610>>DFA<<1610>> inherently requires a great deal more computational power than \gls<<1611>>FFA<<1611>>, since the frequencies need to be selected and allocated with great speed, otherwise the cell requesting a channel will not be able to handle the call and will therefore block the call or drop the call\cite<<1612>>PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications<<1612>>.
\begin<<1714>>tex2html_deferred<<1714>>\par\end<<1715>>tex2html_deferred<<1715>>
This concludes the discussion on the different allocation schemes used in modern cellular networks. In the next section a description is given of what interference is and why it is important for cellular networks. An overview will also be given of when interference occurs.
\begin<<1716>>tex2html_deferred<<1716>>\par\end<<1717>>tex2html_deferred<<1717>>
\section<<1613>>Interference<<1613>>
\label<<1614>>sec:Interference<<1614>>
Interference can be defined as any unwanted signal that is received along with a signal of interest\cite<<1615>>WirelessDigitalCommunications<<1615>>. The unwanted signal is said to \emph<<1616>>interfere<<1616>> with the original signal and as a consequence degrades the original signal quality with unwanted information\cite<<1617>>WirelessDigitalCommunications<<1617>>.
\begin<<1718>>tex2html_deferred<<1718>>\par\end<<1719>>tex2html_deferred<<1719>>
Interference usually occurs when two or more entities communicate independently on the same channel or on adjacent frequencies\cite<<1618>>WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications<<1618>>. Other external factors can also contribute to interference on a communication link, such as machines, which inherently produce some sort of electromagnetic distortion, for instance a car's ignition or a big turbine\cite<<1619>>WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications<<1619>>. 
end<<1620>>figure<<1620>>
Interference that occurs when two signals operate on the same channel can be seen in figure~\ref<<1621>>fig:sameinterference<<1621>> and interference that occurs as a consequence of two signals operating on adjacent frequencies can be seen in figure~\ref<<1622>>fig:adjacentinterference<<1622>>.
