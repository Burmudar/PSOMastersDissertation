\section<<398>>Introduction<<398>>
 Wireless technology is used by modern electronic devices to establish communication over which information is exchanged\cite<<399>>Karen2004<<399>>. Wireless technology facilitates communication between two devices by transmitting data or voice via a radio frequency\cite<<400>>Karen2004<<400>>. Examples of devices exchanging information wirelessly are radios for audio entertainment; television remotes to change channels; cellular phones for communication; wireless access points to create wireless LANs\cite<<401>>Karen2004<<401>>.
\begin<<593>>tex2html_deferred<<593>>\par\end<<594>>tex2html_deferred<<594>>
The popularity and rapid adoption of wireless technology contributes to the difficulty of planning, managing and operating wireless networks\cite<<402>>Karen2004<<402>>. As the popularity and use of services that use wireless technology increase, the need for these services to use different radio frequencies to communicate becomes greater\cite<<403>>wirelesstelcoMullet<<403>>. This need arises due to an effect called \emph<<404>>interference<<404>>, which occurs when two or more connections between devices use the same radio frequency to facilitate communication\cite<<405>>wirelesstelcoMullet<<405>>. This effect is discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
\begin<<595>>tex2html_deferred<<595>>\par\end<<596>>tex2html_deferred<<596>>
A wireless cellular operator is not allowed to operate on just any frequency. A governing body licenses a certain piece of the available wireless spectrum to the operator for use in their network\cite<<406>>FAPRAMColouring<<406>>. These frequencies that need to be licensed for use are known as \emph<<407>>commercial<<407>> frequencies and are very scarce as it is immensely expensive to license\cite<<408>>FAPRAMColouring<<408>>. 
\begin<<597>>tex2html_deferred<<597>>\par\end<<598>>tex2html_deferred<<598>>
The use of frequencies by services must be carefully considered to avoid interference when devices communicate with each other. This is a problem as the amount of devices that communicate far outstrips the amount of frequencies available for communication\cite<<409>>wirelesstelcoMullet<<409>>. Thus assigning frequencies to devices for communication is a difficult problem and is referred to as the \gls<<410>>FAP<<410>>\cite<<411>>Karen2004,Eisenblatter<<411>>.
\begin<<599>>tex2html_deferred<<599>>\par\end<<600>>tex2html_deferred<<600>>
Initially manual techniques were used to assign frequencies in an attempt to solve the \gls<<412>>FAP<<412>>\cite<<413>>Karen2004<<413>>. As a result, assigning frequencies was either too complex or just too daunting because of the sheer number of devices that needed to be assigned frequencies\cite<<414>>Karen2004<<414>>. Also, because of the rapid adoption of wireless technology the assignment of frequencies needed to be dynamic and hence automated\cite<<415>>Karen2004<<415>>.

By understanding how a \gls<<416>>gsm<<416>> network operates, especially how communication is facilitated, the reader is able to understand the problem this dissertation addresses. Therefore, this chapter will start off with section~\ref<<417>>sec:GSMNet<<417>> within which a brief history of \gls<<418>>gsm<<418>> networks are presented. Section~\ref<<419>>sec:GSMArch<<419>> follows the history discussion and presents an overview on the different architectural components the form a \gls<<420>>gsm<<420>> network. In section~\ref<<421>>sec:gsminterfaces<<421>> the different interfaces used by \gls<<422>>gsm<<422>> network components for communication is presented. Section~\ref<<423>>sec:interfacech<<423>> presents an overview on the logical channels that frequencies get divided into when used in a \gls<<424>>gsm<<424>> network. Finally this chapter concludes with a discussion on the handover process in section~\ref<<425>>sec:handover<<425>>.

\section<<426>>GSM Networks<<426>>
\label<<427>>sec:GSMNet<<427>>
The \gls<<428>>gsm<<428>> is a system for multiservice cellular communication that is capable of providing voice as well as data services\cite<<429>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,wirelesstelcoMullet<<429>>. Most cellular networks in operation are \gls<<430>>gsm<<430>> based\cite<<431>>Karen2004,wirelesstelcoMullet<<431>>. The primary service that \gls<<432>>gsm<<432>> caters for is voice communication, but other data services such as \gls<<433>>SMS<<433>>, \gls<<434>>MMS<<434>> and internet connectivity services, e.g. \gls<<435>>GPRS<<435>>, \gls<<436>>EDGE<<436>> and \gls<<437>>HSCSD<<437>>, are becoming more important\cite<<438>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,Eisenblatter<<438>>.
\begin<<605>>tex2html_deferred<<605>>\par\end<<606>>tex2html_deferred<<606>>
\Gls<<439>>gsm<<439>> is one of the most widely used radio communication technologies, which is why one needs to look at the history behind it in order to understand the domain of radio communication better \cite<<440>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<440>>. A brief history of the \gls<<441>>gsm<<441>> network specification will now be presented in the next section.
\begin<<607>>tex2html_deferred<<607>>\par\end<<608>>tex2html_deferred<<608>>
\subsection<<442>>A Brief History of GSM Networks<<442>>
\label<<443>>sec:gsmhistory<<443>>
In early 1981 a group known as the \emph<<444>>Groupe Speciale Mobile<<444>> was established to develop a Europe-wide radio communication system using the reserved 900 MHz band\begin<<609>>tex2html_deferred<<609>>\footnote<<591>>In 1990 the United Kingdom requested that 1800 MHz band be added to the scope of the Groupe Speciale Mobile standard group. This variant of the \gls<<445>>gsm<<445>> specification became known as the \gls<<446>>DCS1800<<446>> \cite<<447>>GSM92,Karen2004<<447>>.<<591>>\end<<610>>tex2html_deferred<<610>>
\begin<<611>>tex2html_deferred<<611>>\par\end<<612>>tex2html_deferred<<612>>
At the start of the \gls<<448>>gsm<<448>> specification in the early 1980s it was initially thought that the system would be analogue based, but this soon changed with the \gls<<449>>ISDN<<449>> specification nearing completion\cite<<450>>GSM92<<450>>. As such the \gls<<451>>gsm<<451>> specification started following many of the same design principles and access protocols that \gls<<452>>ISDN<<452>> exhibited\cite<<453>>GSM92<<453>>.
\begin<<613>>tex2html_deferred<<613>>\par\end<<614>>tex2html_deferred<<614>>
After the completion of the \gls<<454>>ISDN<<454>> specification, the advantages of switching to digital instead of analogue for communication became clear\cite<<455>>GSM92<<455>> One of the primary advantages of \gls<<456>>ISDN<<456>> is that it is capable of transmitting data at higher speeds\cite<<457>>GSM92<<457>> \gls<<458>>gsm<<458>> would therefore be based on digital transmission and speech would be represented by a digital stream of 16 kbits/s \cite<<459>>GSM92<<459>>.
\begin<<615>>tex2html_deferred<<615>>\par\end<<616>>tex2html_deferred<<616>>
Before the switch to digital transmission was finalised the Groupe Speciale Mobile first wanted to evaluate the spectral efficiency of analogue and digital-based transmission\cite<<460>>GSM92<<460>>. Spectral efficiency plays an important part in wireless communication since the radio spectrum is a limited resource and whichever transmission technology is used, the utilisation of the spectrum should be maximised\cite<<461>>GSM92<<461>>. 
\begin<<617>>tex2html_deferred<<617>>\par\end<<618>>tex2html_deferred<<618>>
Maximum utilisation is an important problem that is discussed in detail in later sections of this chapter. After an evaluation of spectral efficiency it was decided that the \gls<<462>>gsm<<462>> system would be digitally based using \gls<<463>>TDMA<<463>> \cite<<464>>GSM92,GSMSysEngin<<464>>. \gls<<465>>TDMA<<465>> is discussed in section~\ref<<466>>sec:interfacech<<466>>.
\begin<<619>>tex2html_deferred<<619>>\par\end<<620>>tex2html_deferred<<620>>
By the early 1990â€™s \gls<<467>>gsm<<467>> became an evolving standard and the first \gls<<468>>gsm<<468>>-based network was demonstrated in 1991\begin<<621>>tex2html_deferred<<621>>\footnote<<592>>Near the end of 1991 the \gls<<469>>gsm<<469>> group was renamed \emph<<470>>Speciale Mobile Group<<470>> (SMG) to eliminate confusion between the standard and the group<<592>>\end<<622>>tex2html_deferred<<622>>\cite<<471>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,Eisenblatter<<471>>. The following year a number of \gls<<472>>gsm<<472>> networks were operating in Europe due to mobile terminals and equipment capable of operating on the networks becoming more widely available to the general public\cite<<473>>GSM92,Eisenblatter<<473>>. In the same year an operator in Australia became the first non-European operator to implement a \gls<<474>>gsm<<474>>-based network\cite<<475>>Eisenblatter<<475>>.
\begin<<623>>tex2html_deferred<<623>>\par\end<<624>>tex2html_deferred<<624>>
The collective subscriber base of \gls<<476>>gsm<<476>> networks surpassed the million subscriber mark in 1993\cite<<477>>GSM92<<477>>. Due to this phenomenal growth in \gls<<478>>gsm<<478>> network use, numerous extensions were made to the \gls<<479>>gsm<<479>> specification. 
Some of the extensions that were made are the following\cite<<480>>GSM92,GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<480>>:
\begin<<481>>itemize<<481>>
\item Half rate speech codec
\item Improved SMS
\item Line identification
\item Call waiting
\item Call holding
\end<<482>>itemize<<482>>
The specification with these extensions is known as \gls<<483>>gsm<<483>> Phase 2+. As the world shifted towards more digital and data-intensive services it became difficult to deliver these services over \gls<<484>>gsm<<484>> networks. This difficulty was due to the restriction that data could only be transmitted at 9.6 kbps \cite<<485>>GSM92,Karen2004<<485>>. 
\begin<<625>>tex2html_deferred<<625>>\par\end<<626>>tex2html_deferred<<626>>
This restriction also applies to voice, as voice is encoded into data that is transmitted over the network\cite<<486>>Karen2004, GSM92<<486>>. Before the extensions were made, voice was encoded using the Full Rate codec\cite<<487>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<487>>. The Full rate codec was the first codec used to encode voice in the \gls<<488>>gsm<<488>> standard and required the full 9.6 kpbs that was available\cite<<489>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<489>>. With half rate speech telephony, only half of the 9.6 kpbs is required for the same voice quality to be delivered\cite<<490>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<490>>.  
\begin<<627>>tex2html_deferred<<627>>\par\end<<628>>tex2html_deferred<<628>>
The new specification defined new technologies such as GPRS, EDGE and HSCSD, which were designed with the primary goal of making more bandwidth available for data transmission \cite<<491>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,Karen2004<<491>>. Data transmission was improved by these technologies by enabling more than one \gls<<492>>gsm<<492>> slot to be used for a terminal or service at a time\cite<<493>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,Karen2004<<493>>.
\begin<<629>>tex2html_deferred<<629>>\par\end<<630>>tex2html_deferred<<630>>
If more than one \gls<<494>>gsm<<494>> slot is to be used by a terminal or service, transceivers are required to have a higher \gls<<495>>SIR<<495>> ratio \cite<<496>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,GSMSysEngin<<496>>. This requirement affects radio interfaces as there is a higher likelihood that interference might occur; hence it makes it more difficult to generate a low interference frequency plan \cite<<497>>Eisenblatter,GSMSysEngin<<497>>. 
\begin<<631>>tex2html_deferred<<631>>\par\end<<632>>tex2html_deferred<<632>>
The actual \gls<<498>>SIR<<498>> at a receiver is dependent on a number of factors that include \cite<<499>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices,Karen2004<<499>>:
\begin<<500>>itemize<<500>>
\item Frequency used at the transceiver
\item Strength of the signal
\item Weather conditions
\item Shape of the surrounding environment
\item Direction of the transmission
\end<<501>>itemize<<501>>
Even taking these factors into account, the calculation of the \gls<<502>>SIR<<502>> at a transceiver is not trivial. This calculation of the \gls<<503>>SIR<<503>> as well as its impact on mobile radio frequencies is discussed in section~\ref<<504>>sec:Interference<<504>>.
\begin<<633>>tex2html_deferred<<633>>\par\end<<634>>tex2html_deferred<<634>>
As the \gls<<505>>gsm<<505>> standard matured as a cellular technology, industry experts began specification of the next generation of cellular networks, which would in time replace the \gls<<506>>gsm<<506>> cellular system. 
\begin<<635>>tex2html_deferred<<635>>\par\end<<636>>tex2html_deferred<<636>>
The \gls<<507>>UMTS<<507>> is considered the third generation (3G) of cellular networks\cite<<508>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<508>>. \gls<<509>>UMTS<<509>> was designed from the beginning to operate in parallel with the legacy \gls<<510>>gsm<<510>> system. The first standard of \gls<<511>>UMTS<<511>> was issued in the beginning of 2000 and subsequently most modern networks are based on it or are migrating their networks to it\cite<<512>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<512>>.
\begin<<637>>tex2html_deferred<<637>>\par\end<<638>>tex2html_deferred<<638>>
UMTS is a major improvement over the \gls<<513>>gsm<<513>> in two areas, namely data transmission bandwidth and frequency planning due to \gls<<514>>UMTS<<514>> utilising \gls<<515>>DS-CDMA<<515>> and \gls<<516>>WCDMA<<516>>\cite<<517>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<517>>. The higher data transmission speed (2 Mb/s) can be attributed to \gls<<518>>UMTS<<518>> using the \gls<<519>>DS-CDMA<<519>> scheme\cite<<520>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<520>>. The scheme also allows more users to be served than previous generations of networks\cite<<521>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<521>>. 
\begin<<639>>tex2html_deferred<<639>>\par\end<<640>>tex2html_deferred<<640>>
DS-CDMA and \gls<<522>>WCDMA<<522>> sends data over a wide band spectrum of 5 MHz. The wider spectrum allows for more frequencies to be utilised and with more frequencies being available; the \gls<<523>>FAP<<523>> is easier to solve compared to a \gls<<524>>gsm<<524>> network\cite<<525>>tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter<<525>>\@. A more in depth discussion on how a range of spectrum is divided into frequencies for communication in \gls<<526>>gsm<<526>> networks is discussed in section~\ref<<527>>sec:interfacech<<527>>. \gls<<528>>DS-CDMA<<528>> and \gls<<529>>WCDMA<<529>> will not be discussed in depth as this discussion focusses on \gls<<530>>gsm<<530>>\@. The interested reader is directed to \cite<<531>>tabuglobalplanning3g<<531>> and \cite<<532>>wirelesstelcoMullet<<532>> for more information.
\begin<<641>>tex2html_deferred<<641>>\par\end<<642>>tex2html_deferred<<642>>
\Gls<<533>>CDMA<<533>> is a technology primarily used in broadband systems\cite<<534>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<534>>. Users do not gain access to only a small portion of the bandwidth, but rather use the entire band for the duration of a connection\cite<<535>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<535>>. Users also do not gain exclusive access to the whole band, but instead share the usage of the bandwidth with other users simultaneously, hence the name \emph<<536>>multiple access<<536>>\cite<<537>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<537>>.
\begin<<643>>tex2html_deferred<<643>>\par\end<<644>>tex2html_deferred<<644>>
With \gls<<538>>CDMA<<538>> a user's signal is not transmitted as its original signal. Instead the signal is spectrally spread over a multiple of its original bandwidth using a spreading factor \cite<<539>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<539>>. The spreading factor fluctuates between values of 10 and 1 000 \cite<<540>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<540>>. Using these spreading factors less interference and fewer disturbances are encountered because the broadband signal is generated from a narrowband signal \cite<<541>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<541>>.
UMTS may be a major improvement, but its adoption does not spread very far from busy city centers where there is a large concentration of clients in a small geographical area\cite<<542>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<542>>. The reason for this is that, as mentioned previously, \gls<<543>>UMTS<<543>> caters for larger data usage and therefore more clients can be serviced simultaneously \cite<<544>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<544>>.
\begin<<645>>tex2html_deferred<<645>>\par\end<<646>>tex2html_deferred<<646>>
Most network operators do not implement entirely new backbone architecture for \gls<<545>>UMTS<<545>>\label<<546>>UMTSGSMBackbone<<546>> to operate on, but instead utilise the same backbone used for \gls<<547>>gsm<<547>> and GPRS\@\cite<<548>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<548>>. This not only extends the lifetime of previous infrastructure investment by the operator, but also builds upon the redundancy provided by the \gls<<549>>gsm<<549>> network \cite<<550>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<550>>. Thus even with new technological improvements such as \gls<<551>>UMTS<<551>>, \gls<<552>>gsm<<552>> as a wireless technology is still used for communication and is therefore still relevant today\cite<<553>>GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<553>>.
\begin<<647>>tex2html_deferred<<647>>\par\end<<648>>tex2html_deferred<<648>>
The most up-to-date cellular network technology is referred to as the fourth generation of cellular networks (4G)\cite<<554>>4GWirelessVid<<554>>. The purpose of 4G is to improve upon 3G and bring true broadband speeds that is delivered over the cellular network\cite<<555>>4GWirelessVid<<555>>. There are currently two competing technologies that aim to provide 4G capabilities to cellular networks which is \gls<<556>>LTE<<556>> and Mobile \gls<<557>>WIMAX<<557>>\cite<<558>>4GWirelessVid<<558>>. Both technologies provide broadband speeds in the range of 14 - 40 MBits/s\cite<<559>>4GWirelessVid<<559>>. According to the 4G standard both technologies cannot be considered as ``true'' 4G technologies as the standard defines that broadband speeds in excess of 100 Mbits/s must be provided to be considered true \gls<<560>>LTE<<560>>\cite<<561>>4GWirelessVid<<561>>.

In this section a brief overview on the history of the \gls<<562>>gsm<<562>> network was presented. In the next section an explanation of the topology of \gls<<563>>gsm<<563>> network is given. This will broaden the understanding of \gls<<564>>gsm<<564>> networks.
\section<<565>>Topology of a GSM Network<<565>>
\label<<566>>sec:GSMArch<<566>>
A \gls<<567>>gsm<<567>> network consists of a variety of different subsystems to realise the goal of establishing a radio communication link between two parties. The hierarchy of systems and their respective connections to each other are illustrated in figure~\ref<<568>>fig:GSMArchitecture<<568>>. Each subsystem will now be discussed.

\subsubsection<<569>>Mobile Station<<569>>
A \gls<<570>>MS<<570>>  as it is defined in the \gls<<571>>gsm<<571>> specification refers to any mobile device that is capable of making and receiving calls on a \gls<<572>>gsm<<572>> network.  The \gls<<573>>MS<<573>> is the main gateway 
for a user to gain access to the \gls<<574>>gsm<<574>> network \cite<<575>>Eisenblatter,GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices<<575>>. Typical devices that fall under the category of \gls<<576>>MS<<576>> are cellular phones, smart phones and \gls<<577>>POS<<577>> devices. The \gls<<578>>MS<<578>> has two features that play an important role throughout the \gls<<579>>gsm<<579>> network, namely:
\begin<<580>>description<<580>>
  \item[\gls<<581>>SIM<<581>>] --- Inserted into a mobile device. The \gls<<582>>SIM<<582>> contains the \gls<<583>>IMSI<<583>> and is used throughout the network for authentication as well as being a key part in providing encrypted transmissions \cite<<584>>Eisenblatter<<584>>.
\item[\gls<<585>>IMEI<<585>>] --- Used to identify mobile station equipment. Primarily used in the denial of service to equipment that has been blacklisted\begin<<653>>tex2html_deferred<<653>>\footnote<<586>>Equipment can be blacklisted for a variety of reasons, e.g.\ theft<<586>>\end<<654>>tex2html_deferred<<654>> and tries to gain access to the network \cite<<587>>Eisenblatter<<587>>.
