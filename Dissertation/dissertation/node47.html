Minimum Order Frequency Assignment Problem</A>
</H2>
The <#1884#>MO-FAP<#1884#> was the first <#1885#>FAP<#1885#> that emerged in the 1970s. The <#1886#>MO-FAP<#1886#> is concerned with assigning frequencies to transmitters while interference is minimised as well as minimising the number of different frequencies that are used[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
In <#1888#>MO-FAP<#1888#> channel reuse is prioritised and the usage of a channel has a certain cost associated with it. The reason for this is that when the wireless network industry started, operators were billed according to the number of different frequencies they used. In the beginning of commercial cellular networks frequencies were not cheap since they were sold per unit [#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Over the years as the law governing the wireless spectrum changed and new technology as well as standards emerged, <#1890#>MO-FAP<#1890#> lost its relevancy[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Companies are no longer billed according to the different frequencies they use, but they purchase licences from a regulatory body[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This licence usually stipulates what channel band the network is allowed to use.

<P>
In some instances a certain band of frequencies is put up for auction by a regulatory body, on which interested parties can bid to own the specified spectrum[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Due to the shift in how frequencies are allocated to networks, neither the regulatory bodies nor the network operators care about the number of different frequencies are used[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
