The Particle Swarm</A>
</H3>
The initialising of particles in a swarm are the same as used by traditional population-based evolutionary algorithm to initialise their respective populations [#FixedFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  At the start of the algorithm the swarm is initialised by randomly generating possible solutions that will represent the position of particles[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The <#4376#>PSO<#4376#> algorithm in some aspects resembles evolutionary algorithms like the genetic algorithm since it also has a population that operates in the problem space in search of an optimal solution. However unlike some of the variants that exist for the <#4377#>GA<#4377#> utilise good mutation operators are able have new genetic material to be inserted into the population. At least in the initial search phase of the GA, this increases diversity[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#4379#>PSO<#4379#> does not continually generate new solutions to be reinserted into the swarm to increase diversity [#PSOHybridUnitCommit#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus the swarm size needs to be adjusted to get an optimal representation of the search space because as particles move in the swarm, the diversity among particles decreases rapidly as information is shared [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The diversity of the swarm is not only dependant on the sharing model used but also on the parameters used for velocity updatign of partciles. Most important of these parameters are the inertia weight and accelaration coefficients. Depending on the values used the diversity of the swarm decreases as the swarm moves because, with each iteration, the swarm converges towards the neighbourhood best position[#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This occurs due to the velocity equation directs the general movement of a particle in the direction of the neighbourhood best[#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. If the best position in the neighbourhood does not change as the algorithm processes more iterations, a larger portion of the swarm will soon occupy a position which is a weighted average between the neighbourhood and each individual particles personal best[#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. On the other hand, if the wrong values are used, the diversity of the swarm will increase, but there is also the possibility that the swarm will diverge never to converge to a single solution but having increased diversity[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Diversity among the particles in the swarm is important and at least initially must be maintained for the search space to be explored adequeately. As discussed previously, depending on the neighbourhood topolgy used diversity can be increased. In the next section neighbourhood topolgies is discussed.
