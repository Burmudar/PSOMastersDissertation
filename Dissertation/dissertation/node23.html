Topology of a GSM Network
</H1>
A <#567#>gsm<#567#> network consists of a variety of different subsystems to realise the goal of establishing a radio communication link between two parties. The hierarchy of systems and their respective connections to each other are illustrated in figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:GSMArchitecture#568><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Each subsystem will now be discussed.
