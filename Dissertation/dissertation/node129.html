ABC algorithm on the FAP</A>
</H2>
The <#4320#>ABC<#4320#> algorithm and all its variants are relatively new. To date it has only been applied to a select few problems such as the traveling salesman problem.

<P>
As yet, no research has been done to apply the <#4321#>ABC<#4321#> algorithm to the <#4322#>FAP<#4322#>. The following critique is based on a theoretic implementation of the <#4323#>ABC<#4323#> algorithm on the <#4324#>FAP<#4324#>. Based on this evaluation the following obstacles can be identified if one were to apply the algorithm to the <#4325#>FAP<#4325#>:
