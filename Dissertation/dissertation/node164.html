Velocity Method 1 vs Method 2</A>
</H2>
The FAP PSO algorithm is able to utilise two different velocity methods to move the swarm around in the FAP space. The algorithms that implement these two methods were presented in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:velocityFAP#6640><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:velocityFAP2#6641><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
By analysing the results, it becomes abundantly clear that velocity method 1 is by far the superior method for moving in the problem space. In each of the results, when comparing end fitness values produced by algorithm variants that use method 1 one can easily come to the conclusion that method 1 performs better than method 2.

<P>
As discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#6642><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, method 1 uses a stage-based approach when applying the velocity function whereas method 2 applies the velocity function as is without it being broken up. Based on the results, using a stage-based approach to apply the velocity function is far better than applying the velocity equation directly to the transceiver in the plan.

<P>
Method 1 works by moving the whole swarm through to each stage before applying the next stage in the velocity equation. Thus after each stage, the whole swarm is at the same phase of the equation which keeps the swarm structured.

<P>
With method 2, the whole velocity equation is applied to whatever value is exposed to be operated on. Thus when method 2 moves a particle the frequency plan is moved piece by piece to some destination in the problem space.

<P>
By applying the velocity equation it is difficult to control the algorithm search process. With the FAP PSO control is necessary as there are various constraints which must not only be avoided but also adhered to for the generated plan to be usable. With method 2 adding domain knowledge is difficult, since after the velocity equation has been calculated the particle is very close to being moved to a new position. All that still needs to be done, before a particle is moved, is to apply inertia, which means there is a little check that can be done to ensure that all the frequency values are within acceptable bounds.

<P>
By breaking the velocity equation up into smaller parts (stages) using method 1 the algorithm is able to direct and ensure that the swarm is moving in the general direction of valid frequency allocations.

<P>
Also the algorithm is able to embed domain knowledge earlier into the calculation of the velocity and is therefore able to intercept early on movements that will result in invalid frequency allocations at each stage of the velocity equation.
