Search Spaces and States</A>
</H1>
A search space is defined as a set of candidate goal states which may or may not be a solution to an problem[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The candidate states are defined by the problem definition[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The possible states can be given by a successor function which generates new states adhering to the problem defined constraints if any[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The search space can also be explicitly defined with constraints to which a solution must adhere to[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When constraints are defined it is up to the algorithm how it moves from one state to another in the search space[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each state the algorithm moves to is then checked whether it adheres to the constraints[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A state is a position in the search space[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This position represents a configuration that describes a possible solution to the defined problem[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When a algorithm is said to be moving to a new state, the algorithm moves to a new position in the search space[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This new position represents a different solution than the previous position that was occupied[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
When dealing with an optimisation problem there can be more than one solution[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Which is why with optimisation problems not only does an algorithm have to find a solution, but also the most optimal solution among the candidate solutions[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This subset of solutions in the search space is referred to as the <I>solution</I> space.

<P>
Both concepts of search spaces and states have now been defined. All search algorithms operate in search spaces and occupy states. The domain of search contains a wide variety of algortihms. In the next section Metaheuristics Algorithms are discussed as this body of algorithms are used to solved optimisation problems.
