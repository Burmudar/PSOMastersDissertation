Introduction</A>

In the technology age, life is almost unfathomable without the mobile phone. It is hard to believe how the business world managed to function in the pre-mobile phone era<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot338"><SUP>1.1</SUP></A>. 

<P>
The invention of the mobile phone fulfilled the need to always be connected and be within reach of the modern world. This need can actually be attributed to feeling part of something and this something is deemed as being part of a network. This is similar to how mobile phones are able to provide connectivity at almost any location within a country.

<P>
Behind the connectivity of mobile phones lies an intricate layer of communication technology which has evolved since the invention of the normal landline phone. This technology is referred to at the top level as wireless communication, which includes inventions such as the radio. To enable communication at the level needed by mobile phones, wireless communication had to evolve and go a step further than normal radio communication. Hence the concept of cellular mobile networks was developed.

<P>
Without cellular networks mobile phones have no means of providing communication. The purpose of the cellular network is to provide the necessary functions to connect and facilitate communication between two entities (mobile phones) over a wireless network. 

<P>
Cellular networks achieve this level of communication through expensive equipment and ``smart'' algorithms. By ``smart'' algorithms, what is actually meant is algorithms that utilise artificial intelligence concepts to perform a certain function in an attempt to either automate a task within the network or improve a certain part of the network. Therefore, the correct term for these types of algorithms is actually artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

<P>
AI algorithms have a wide spread of functions that they can perform ranging from making informed intelligent decisions to optimising the operation of certain processes. In particular computers are indeed very apt at optimising certain procedures. This is because a computer is able to test and evaluate a huge number of different alterations and combinations of a certain procedure in a short amount of time, thereby allowing it to find the best combination out of those tested.

<P>
In this dissertation an algorithm is presented which concentrates on cellular phone networks. This particular algorithm falls into the latter part of the AI algorithms discussed, namely an AI optimisation algorithm. Thus the algorithm presented in this dissertation operates on a cellular phone network to optimise a certain part of the network.

<P>
In this section a introduction was presented to the dissertation. The main themes of the dissertation were outlined namely, cellular phone networks and optimisation algorithms. In the next section research plan and chapter breakdown is presented which is followed by this dissertation.
