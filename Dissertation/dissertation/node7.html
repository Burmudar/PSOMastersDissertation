Research Questions and Objective</A>
</H1>
As previously discussed, an artificial intelligent algorithm is presented in this dissertation that generates plans for use by cellular networks. The purpose of creating such an algorithm is to determine the applicability of modern swarm-based algorithms with regard to finding better solutions to real-world problems that exist in domains such as cellular communication.

<P>
The research approach followed in this dissertation was first and foremost to understand the cellular network domain. More importantly, the focus is on how and what frequencies are used to facilitate communication as well as what affects the quality of the communicational link between two entities in a cellular network. 

<P>
The cellular domain is the problem domain, but to develop a solution in the problem domain a study needs to be conducted in the artificial intelligence domain, namely a study of optimisation algorithms. In order for a new optimisation algorithm to be developed, other algorithms that have achieved success in the respective optimisation problem domains in which they have been applied need to be investigated.

<P>
Therefore in an attempt to develop and apply a modern viable optimisation-based algorithm, a series of research questions has been identified which need to be answered. The research questions are as follows:

<UL>
<LI><B>Question 1</B> --- What is cellular technology, how it got developed and what improvements have been made since its initial development?
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 2</B> --- What is the architecture behind a modern cellular network, how do the various hardware entities within a network communicate with each other and how is a communicational link established between two users of the network?
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 3</B> --- What exactly is the frequency problem and how does it affect modern wireless communication?
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 4</B> --- What variants of the frequency problem exist and which are most applicable to cellular networks?
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 5</B> --- What are the most popular optimisation algorithms and what characteristics make them unique?
</LI>
<LI><B>Question 6</B> --- With algorithms that achieved success in their respective optimisation problems, what particular technique is used by the algorithms that allowed them to achieve better performance?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The PSO algorithm might be short and elegant, but applying it to the FS-FAP required various new techniques in response to the following questions:

<UL>
<LI>How can a particle best be represented as a frequency plan?
</LI>
<LI>How can one frequency plan move to another?
</LI>
<LI>How can particles be prevented from using forbidden frequencies when they fly towards a particular plan?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The above questions were only the preliminary questions and were in fact a problem that had to be addressed for successful application of the PSO to the FAP. In chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#350><tex2html_cr_mark></A> a discussion is presented on how these problems were solved as well as how other problems were solved that were not anticipated.

<P>
Throughout the course of this dissertation the aim is to answer each of these identified research questions. In the next section a chapter breakdown of this dissertation is presented.

<P>
The aim of this dissertation is first and foremost to answer the identified research questions. Answering these questions will aid in reaching the research objective of this dissertation. The research objective is therefore to develop and determine the viability of an algorithm based on modern swarm optimisation techniques that will operate on the frequency assignment problem in an attempt to provide better frequency plans for use in cellular networks.
