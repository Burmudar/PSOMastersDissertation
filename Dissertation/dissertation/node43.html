Fixed Frequency/Channel Assignment</A>
</H2>
<#1574#>FFA<#1574#> is the process of permanently assigning frequencies to cells [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The frequencies assigned are fixed and cannot be changed immediately while the network is active, since the frequencies assigned to the cell form part of a delicate frequency plan designed to keep interference on communication links to a minimum[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
When the channel used by a particular cell for communication is suddenly changed, the cell might start interfering with neighbouring cells' communication links. This interference is caused because the assigned frequencies of the neighbouring cells are close to each other on the frequency spectrum. Hence, if the cell is sectored (refer to section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#def:cellsector#1577><tex2html_cr_mark></A> in chapter two for a discussion on cell sectorisation) it can interfere with a minimum of three and up to a maximum of six neighbouring cells[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
When an <#1579#>FFA<#1579#> plan is created, cells are assigned frequencies based on the estimated traffic that cell will be expected to handle during peak network usage. <#1580#>FFA<#1580#> is ideally suited for macro cellular networks since the nature of the traffic encountered in such networks has the characteristic of being homogeneous, stationary and predictable [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Cellular networks can be classified as being in the macro cellular group of wireless networks.

<P>
With <#1582#>FFA<#1582#>, networks are able to permanently allocate a certain subset of frequencies to cells since the nature of the traffic on their network allows them to predict with reasonable certainty the call blocking probability [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A call is blocked on the network when a cell has no available frequencies to use when establishing a communication link [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In situations where the nature of the traffic is neither homogeneous nor stationary, using the <#1585#>FFA<#1585#> allocation scheme is not feasible as its use of available frequencies is grossly inefficient [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A problem that occurs with <#1587#>FFA<#1587#> when all assigned frequencies are in use is that any new call or call handed over will be blocked[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The call will be blocked even if adjacent cells have suitable capacity to handle the call[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
