Crossover</A>
</H4>
--- The crossover operation in the <#3083#>GA<#3083#> is the only means by which successive populations are generated and can therefore be regarded as the primary means by which the algorithm performs its search. As the crossover is defined in the standard algorithm, certain parts of both parents are copied and combined to form a new individual. With regard to the <#3084#>FAP<#3084#>, if each individual represents a frequency plan, the crossover operation would copy certain cells from the two parent plans. This is not desirable, since a single channel within a cell can generate major interference which overshadows the rest of the channels that generate low interference in the cell. Thus, for the <#3085#>GA<#3085#> to generate high quality solutions on the <#3086#>FAP<#3086#>, the algorithm would be better off utilising a crossover operation which works on individual channels assigned rather than cells. Crossover operation is also a memory and computationally expensive operation since individuals need to be constantly created and values need to be copied to these new individuals from the respective parents.
