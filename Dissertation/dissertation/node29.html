Authentication centre</A>

--- The AUC is the entity in the <#848#>gsm<#848#> network that performs security functions and thus stores information that enables it to provide secure over-the-air communication[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The information that is stored contains authentication information as well as keys that are used in ciphering information[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
During an authentication procedure no ciphering key is ever transmitted over the air; instead a challenge is issued to the mobile that needs to be authenticated. This challenge requires the mobile station to provide the correct <#851#>SRES<#851#> with regard to the random number generated by the <#852#>AUC<#852#>[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The random number and ciphering keys that are used change with each call that is made; thus an attacker would gain nothing by intercepting a key, since it will change with the next call [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Each mobile that is registered in the <#855#>HLR<#855#> database needs to be authenticated and each call that is instantiated needs to retrieve keys from the AUC to establish a secure communication link[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The AUC is sometimes included with <#857#>HLR<#857#> to allow for fast communication between the two databases [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
