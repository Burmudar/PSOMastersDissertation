ACO on the FAP</A>
</H2>
ACO has been applied to a wide number of problems and has produced good results. As discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:fap#4072><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, the <#4073#>FAP<#4073#> can be modelled as a graph and therefore the <#4074#>ACO<#4074#> has also been applied to it.

<P>
When using the <#4075#>ACO<#4075#> algorithm on the <#4076#>FAP<#4076#> the ants need to construct a path that represents a frequency plan and has low interference. With the <#4077#>ACO<#4077#>, a node is a cell that has a unique set of channels assigned to it. Thus the same cell may exist in the search space, but will have a different set of channels assigned to it, and will therefore represent an entirely different node to the <#4078#>ACO<#4078#>.

<P>
As an ant moves in the frequency planning domain, it is actually moving between two cells that are said to interfere. The interference between two cells occurs as a consequence of the channels that have been assigned to them. 

<P>
As an ant completes a movement from one cell to another, i.e. it assigns channels to the cell, it measures the interference that occurs due to the assignment.  The measured interference information is incorporated into the pheromone, which the ant will deposit on the link between the two cells.

<P>
An optimal frequency plan would therefore be a path through all the interfering cells marked with a high dosage of pheromone. As discussed in the previous sections, the pheromone indicates the desirability of a particular path. In the <#4079#>FAP<#4079#>, a desirable path would be one where interference is low; thus a path with a high dosage of pheromones would be the frequency plan with the lowest interference found by the algorithm.

<P>
When analysing the basic <#4080#>ACO<#4080#> algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:ACO#4081><tex2html_cr_mark></A> one can identify the following possible disadvantages if the algorithm were applied to the <#4082#>FAP<#4082#>:
