PSO COST 259 Siemens Results</A>
</H1>
The PSO was applied to the benchmarks on the following machine and frameworks:

<UL>
<LI>4 GB RAM
</LI>
<LI>Windows 7
</LI>
<LI>Intel Quad Core CPU
</LI>
<LI>C# using .Net 4 Framework with Parallel Extensions
</LI>
</UL>
The FAP PSO was applied to Siemens1, Siemens2, Siemens3 and Siemen4 of the COST 259 benchmark suite. For more information about the nature of the benchmarks, the reader is directed to section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:COST259#6547><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
For each benchmark, 12 results are presented. The following changes were made to the FAP PSO to obtain 12 different results:

<UL>
<LI>The two velocity methods that were developed for the PSO were tested.
</LI>
<LI>Each velocity method also used the three different global best mechanisms that were developed.
</LI>
<LI>The swarm size was set to 20, 50, 100, 500.
</LI>
<LI>Inertia was set to 0.5.
</LI>
<LI>Cognitive coefficient was set to 0.4.
</LI>
<LI>Social coefficient was set to 0.5.
</LI>
<LI>Each variant of FAP PSO was allowed 15 minutes on each of the benchmarks.
</LI>
</UL>
The velocity methods and global selection schemes were discussed in the previous chapter.

<P>
In the following sections the results obtained are tabulated.
