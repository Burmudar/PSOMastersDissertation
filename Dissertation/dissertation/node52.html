Philadelphia Benchmarks</A>
</H2>
The Philadelphia benchmarks are derived from an instance that was introduced in 1973 by Anderson[#AndersonPhiladelphia#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each instance is a hexagonal grid of cells that overlaps the area of interest. At the centre of each cell there is a transmitter. Past approaches used these hexagonal systems to model modern cellular networks [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ExactMIFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In this benchmark interference is measured by a co-channel reuse distance[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This distance stipulates that the difference between the frequencies  assigned to two cells must be greater than or equal to a certain value <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15069#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. A channel cannot be assigned to a cell if it violates this minimum distance [#ExactMIFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
These benchmarks are typically used to test algorithms developed for <#2024#>MS-FAP<#2024#>, since there is no concept of cost or penalty for interference incurred by violating constraints.
