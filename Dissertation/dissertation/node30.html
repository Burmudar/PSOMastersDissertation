Equipment identity register</A>
</H4>
--- The <#860#>EIR<#860#> is a database that stores the <#861#>IMEI<#861#> numbers of all registered mobile equipment that has accessed the network[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Only information about the mobile equipment is stored, nothing about the subscriber or call is stored in the databas[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Typically there is only one <#864#>EIR<#864#> database per network and interfaces to the <#865#>HLR<#865#> databases contained in the network[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#867#>IMEI<#867#> are grouped into three categories: <I>white list</I>, <I>black list</I> and the <I>gray list</I>[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] The white list contains only the <#872#>IMEI<#872#> numbers of valid <#873#>MS<#873#>; the black list stores the <#874#>IMEI<#874#> numbers of equipment that has been reported stolen and the gray list stores the <#875#>IMEI<#875#> numbers of equipment that has some fault (faulty software, wrong make of equipment)[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
