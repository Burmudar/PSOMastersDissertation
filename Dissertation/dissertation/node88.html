Algorithm Efficiency</A>
</H3>
The algorithm is also efficient with regard to CPU cycles when compared with the genetic algorithm. <#2778#>SA<#2778#> only has to evaluate a certain number of moves each iteration, instead of a whole population of individuals each iteration. The genetic algorithm is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:geneticalgorithm#2779><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
Unlike <#2780#>TS<#2780#>, the basic <#2781#>SA<#2781#> algorithm does not keep any memory and is therefore memory efficient, but in contrast suffers the risk that the solution may cycle. The more iterations spent at a temperature, the longer the algorithm spends at a certain temperature and therefore the higher the probability that solutions may cycle.

<P>
In next section the flow of the <#2782#>SA<#2782#> algorithm is discussed and pseudo code for the <#2783#>SA<#2783#> algortihm is presented.
