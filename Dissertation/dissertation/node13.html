This chapter marks the beginning of a discussion on various optimisation algorithms in this dissertation. The algorithms presented in this chapter were chosen due to their widespread usage as well as success on NP-Complete problems. Each algorithm is discussed in depth providing an outline of the core features that make the algorithm unique as well as each core feature in detail. For each algorithm the chapter also presents an analysis on related work of the particular algorithm being applied to the frequency assignment problem.
