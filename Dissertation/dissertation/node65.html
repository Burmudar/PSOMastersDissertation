Summary</A>
</H1>
In this chapter a discussion was presented on the problem this dissertation is based upon. The problem was defined as being the <#2115#>FAP<#2115#> and is categorised as being part of the set of NP-Complete problems. The NP-Complete nature of the problem is an important concept to understand.

<P>
Within the <#2116#>FAP<#2116#> domain there are two different techniques when assigning frequencies. The two different techniques were discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FreqAssignmentTypes#2117><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. 

<P>
An important concept that needs to be understood to comprehend why the <#2118#>FAP<#2118#> exists is the concept of interference. This was discussed in depth in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:Interference#2119><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The <#2120#>FAP<#2120#> is not just one problem but consists of various sub problems that have different goals for the resulting frequency plan. Some problems are concerned with the number of frequencies used, others are more concerned with the amount of interference that is generated on the network.

<P>
The various <#2121#>FAP<#2121#> sub problems were outlined and discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FAPVariants#2122><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
A formal mathematical definition of the <#2123#>MI-FAP<#2123#> was also presented. Finally, this chapter concluded with a discussion on the on the different industries where the FAP is encountered and how the problem is handled.
