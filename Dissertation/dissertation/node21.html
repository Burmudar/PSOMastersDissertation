The <#428#>gsm<#428#> is a system for multiservice cellular communication that is capable of providing voice as well as data services[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Most cellular networks in operation are <#430#>gsm<#430#> based[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The primary service that <#432#>gsm<#432#> caters for is voice communication, but other data services such as <#433#>SMS<#433#>, <#434#>MMS<#434#> and internet connectivity services, e.g. <#435#>GPRS<#435#>, <#436#>EDGE<#436#> and <#437#>HSCSD<#437#>, are becoming more important[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
<#439#>gsm<#439#> is one of the most widely used radio communication technologies, which is why one needs to look at the history behind it in order to understand the domain of radio communication better [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A brief history of the <#441#>gsm<#441#> network specification will now be presented in the next section.
