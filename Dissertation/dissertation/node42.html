Frequency Allocation Types
</H1>
In this section the different methods used to allocate frequencies to cells in a cellular network are discussed. Furthermore the method that relates to the specific <#1561#>FAP<#1561#> variant in this dissertation is described.

<P>
Within the <#1562#>FAP<#1562#> domain there are different types of <#1563#>FAP<#1563#>, which have emerged over the years as the domain of wireless communications matured and technological requirements changed. These <#1564#>FAP<#1564#> variants are discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FAPVariants#1565><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
There are a variety of <#1566#>FAP<#1566#>s in the wireless communication domain but each individual problem can be classified into one of the following two categories based on the way frequencies are assigned to cells:

<UL>
<LI><I><#1568#>FFA<#1568#></I> is where frequencies assigned to cells are static; therefore they cannot be changed until a new assignment plan is calculated[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</LI>
<LI><I><#1570#>DFA<#1570#></I> is the process of allocating frequencies to cells as required to meet the current traffic demand imposed on them by clients[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 
</LI>
</UL>
