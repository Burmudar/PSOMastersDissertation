In this chapter a definition was given of what it means for an algorithm to be classified as metaheuristic and also what characteristics these algorithms must exhibit.

<P>
Three metaheuristic algorithms were discussed in this chapter. Each algorithm was accompanied by a flow chart depicting the general flow of the algorithm. How the algorithm works as well as the various characteristics that make the algorithm unique were described.

<P>
For each algorithm, a brief overview of literature using the particular algorithm was given as well as some of the disadvantages or challenges faced when applying the particular algorithm to the FAP.
