Cellular Communication</A>
</H2>
Cellular communication (see chapter 2 for a discussion) can be considered the main driving force behind research in the frequency assignment domain. As new standards are developed and used in 3G networks, in general an <#2106#>FAP<#2106#> still needs to be solved since these newer technologies still use <#2107#>gsm<#2107#> as their backbone architecture, as discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#UMTSGSMBackbone#2108><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. With new networks being deployed or current networks being expanded, standard <#2109#>gsm<#2109#> is used as it is cheaper than using the latest 3G technology. Therefore, standard <#2110#>gsm<#2110#> is still relevant and in use in modern networks.

<P>
There is a wealth of research that concentrates on the <#2111#>FAP<#2111#> within cellular networks. This is because cellular networks are used by millions of people around the world and as such this presents an interesting notion to produce better results since viable solutions have the possibility to impact millions of people. Most of the literature concentrates on this domain and one can find a lot of research in the literature presenting viable algorithms that produce real-world solutions [#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Because the <#2113#>FAP<#2113#> problem is NP-Complete most presented algorithms are either of the metaheuristic type or more recently of the swarm intelligence type. Both of these algorithmic types are discussed in chapters 4 and 5 respectively.
