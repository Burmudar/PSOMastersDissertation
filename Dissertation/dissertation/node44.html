Dynamic Frequency/Channel Assignment</A>
</H2>
<#1591#>DFA<#1591#> is a channel allocation scheme where frequencies assigned to cells are not permanent but rather assigned to cells as the need arises[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore all the frequencies licensed by a particular network are available to each and every cell to establish a communication link as long as the channel does not violate the co-channel reuse constraint [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The co-channel reuse constraint must be adhered to otherwise the amount of interference occurring on the communication link will be too much[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This constraint forms part of the electromagnetic constraints, which are described in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:Interference#1595><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The <#1596#>DFA<#1596#> allocation scheme is ideally suited for micro cellular wireless networks. The traffic on these networks have the characteristic of being immensely unpredictable as traffic demand varies constantly[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MobileWirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
As the name indicates, micro cellular wireless networks have much smaller cell sizes than macro cellular networks. Thus a cell in a micro cellular network must handle a lot more handover requests than a cell in a macro cellular network, since an <#1598#>MS<#1598#> with an active connection is much more likely to move out of the coverage area of a micro cell than a macro cell [#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Since a micro cellular network has increased handover requests between cells compared with a macro cellular network, a <#1600#>DFA<#1600#> scheme must rapidly allocate frequencies to requesting cells that must handle the handovers[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
<#1602#>DFA<#1602#> is much more efficient than <#1603#>FFA<#1603#> when the amount of mobile traffic on the network is relatively low[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. On the other hand, when the network is under heavy mobile traffic load, the <#1605#>FFA<#1605#> scheme outperforms the <#1606#>DFA<#1606#> scheme[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1608#>DFA<#1608#> shceme is outperformed because it allocates frequencies to cells in an inefficient arrangement that might affect the amount of interference encountered on the network[#MobileWirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Finally <#1610#>DFA<#1610#> inherently requires a great deal more computational power than <#1611#>FFA<#1611#>, since the frequencies need to be selected and allocated with great speed, otherwise the cell requesting a channel will not be able to handle the call and will therefore block the call or drop the call[#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
This concludes the discussion on the different allocation schemes used in modern cellular networks. In the next section a description is given of what interference is and why it is important for cellular networks. An overview will also be given of when interference occurs.
