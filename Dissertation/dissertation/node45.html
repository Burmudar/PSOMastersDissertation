Interference
</H1>
Interference can be defined as any unwanted signal that is received along with a signal of interest[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The unwanted signal is said to <I>interfere</I> with the original signal and as a consequence degrades the original signal quality with unwanted information[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Interference usually occurs when two or more entities communicate independently on the same channel or on adjacent frequencies[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Other external factors can also contribute to interference on a communication link, such as machines, which inherently produce some sort of electromagnetic distortion, for instance a car's ignition or a big turbine[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

Interference that occurs when two signals operate on the same channel can be seen in figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:sameinterference#1621><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and interference that occurs as a consequence of two signals operating on adjacent frequencies can be seen in figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:adjacentinterference#1622><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The impact interference will have on an entity that has established a connection and that operates on the same channel or adjacent channel as another entity decreases as the geographic distance between them increases[#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore, to minimise the impact interference will have on communication links a <I>separation</I> is defined[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. More specifically, this separation is known as the channel reuse or frequency reuse distance within wireless networks[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
This separation is defined as the minimum number of cells (which must all use different frequencies) between one cell, which has been allocated a channel, and another cell before a cell is allowed to reuse the same channel that another cell has been allocated[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The separation can be depicted visually as in figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:seperationgraph#1760><tex2html_cr_mark></A> where <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math50#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14957#

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is allowed to be reused since the two cells it is assigned to are separated by three cells (shaded in grey) because the separation for this network was set to three.

<P>
As discussed earlier, cellular networks are forced to reuse their licensed frequencies multiple times to keep costs to a minimum. Therefore, the design of a cellular network is limited to the defined separation distance between cells as it defines the size of cells that will be in the network[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Smaller cells can lead to a larger separation distance compared with when cells are larger[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Cellular networks use the amount of interference on their networks as a qualitative measure for their <#1802#>QoS<#1802#>[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A network with high interference would experience a lot of dropped connections/calls, which occurs when the interference is too high to sustain a connection or call for communication; consequently their <#1804#>QoS<#1804#> degrades as interference increases[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Even though interference can cause a call or connection to be lost, i.e. dropped, there are other situations where a call can be dropped[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A situation where a call can be dropped is when a handover procedure occurs between two cells and one cell receiving the call is at full utilisation of its allocated frequencies[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Another situation can be due to weather conditions. Weather brings forth natural interference or the caller entering a building which drastically reduces cellular reception[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the literature a variety of methods are used to calculate the amount of interference in a network. The <#1809#>SIR<#1809#> ratio is the recommended way of calculating the potential interference at a certain point [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The <#1811#>SIR<#1811#> equation is actually based on the <#1812#>SINR<#1812#> but since cellular networks are interference limited, the noise is not considered in the interference calculation[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Noise can be disregarded since the power of interference is much larger than the power of noise[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A formulation of the <#1815#>SINR<#1815#> and <#1816#>SIR<#1816#> is as follows:

Where <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14968#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is the power of the received signal and <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14970#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is the power associated with interference from within a cell (intracell interference) and interference from outside a cell (intercell interference)[#WirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
This calculation can be considered a best guess as it models the environment, weather and other factors which may influence the potential interference at a point with a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation for noise represented by the <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14972#

<P>
Using the <#1825#>SIR<#1825#> formula cellular networks are able to determine the <#1826#>BER<#1826#> users on the network will experience on their connections[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1828#>BER<#1828#> is defined as the probability that a received bit on the connection will be incorrect[#MobileWirelessCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
As the <#1830#>BER<#1830#> increases voice quality on the connection decreases since more bits that are used to describe the voice information are incorrectly received[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. <#1832#>SIR<#1832#> and <#1833#>BER<#1833#> probability are interlinked. As <#1834#>SIR<#1834#> increases, i.e. less interference is encountered on the communication link, the probability that bits will be received incorrectly decreases[#WirelessDigitalCommunications#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Whether precise measurements are taken or the interference is calculated based on the <#1836#>SIR<#1836#> formula, the end result of both methods is that all the calculated or measured values are put into a matrix to produce an <I>interference matrix</I>[#ACOvsEA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
An interference matrix consists of a number of cell pairs (<I>i,j</I>), where <I>i</I> is the cell receiving interference and <I>j</I> the cell whose allocated channel is providing the interference[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each cell pair in the matrix has two corresponding values that indicate the level of interference if the <I>electromagnetic constraints</I> are violated [#ACOvsEA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AndreasPaper#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Primarily interference occurs when the electromagnetic constraints are violated. These constraints are defined as:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><#14973#>Co-channel<#14973#></STRONG></DT>
<DD>--- As discussed earlier, when cell <I>i</I> and cell <I>j</I> operate on the same channel interference will occur [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#PrinciplesMobileCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When this type of interference occurs it is referred to as <I>co-channel</I> interference.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><#14974#>Adjacent channel<#14974#></STRONG></DT>
<DD>--- When cell <I>i</I> and cell <I>j</I> operate on adjacent frequencies, their allocated frequencies differ by one, i.e. cell <I>i</I> operates on channel <I>f</I>, then if cell <I>j</I> operates on either channel <I>f - 1</I> or <I>f + 1</I>, then interference will occur[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This type of interference is referred to as <I>adjacent channel</I> interference.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The electromagnetic constraints defined above are applicable in any wireless network. With regard to mobile telecommunication networks, such as cellular networks, there are additional constraints that are imposed due to technological requirements, availability, location and size of area with unacceptable interference [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AndreasPaper#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These constraints are defined as the following:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><#14975#>Co-site<#14975#></STRONG></DT>
<DD>--- If cell <I>i</I> and cell <I>j</I> are located at the same site, then their allocated channel ranges must differ by a certain distance in the frequency domain. This distance is known as the reuse distance where cell <I>i</I> and cell <I>j</I> serve different sectors[#FixedFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#EgyptFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In the benchmarks which are discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FAPBenchmarks#1867><tex2html_cr_mark></A> this distance is also referred to as the <I>separation variable</I>. 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><#14976#>Co-cell<#14976#></STRONG></DT>
<DD>--- Channels used on the same antennae of a cell must differ by a certain number. This is typically set to three but can be any number greater than zero that the network operator deems necessary to avoid unwanted interference[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AndreasPaper#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><#14977#>Handover<#14977#></STRONG></DT>
<DD>--- This constraint means that frequencies must differ by a predefined margin, i.e. two or three, when one cell hands over a call to another cell. If this constraint is violated a mobile subscriber will experience a dropped call since the handover between cells fails[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AndreasPaper#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Within the licences of wireless networks there are two hard constraints which forbid networks from using certain frequencies. Hard constraints means that under no circumstances are these constraints allowed to be violated.

<P>
The first set of hard constraint frequencies is known as <I>globally blocked frequencies</I>. Frequencies that are in the set of globally blocked frequencies are usually frequencies that have been licensed to other networks[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The second set of hard constraint frequencies is known as <I>locally blocked frequencies</I>. These frequencies are not allowed at certain geographic areas but are free for use at any other area[#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A typical area where certain frequencies will be forbidden to be used is near a country border[#InterferenceOrientatedFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The locally blocked frequencies are most likely in use by another network resident to the bordered country.

In this section a description was given of what interference is and what the consequences are of too much interference in a network. This section further elaborated on the circumstances in which interference can occur in a wireless network. In the next section an overview is given of the various different sub problems in the <#1877#>FAP<#1877#> domain.
