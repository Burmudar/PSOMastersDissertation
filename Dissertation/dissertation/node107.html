Summary</A>
</H1>
In this chapter a description was given of metaheuristic algorithms. What it means for an algorithm to be classified as being of a metaheuristic nature was explained as well as the characteristics these algorithms exhibit were identified.

<P>
Three metaheuristic algorithms were discussed in this chapter. For every algorithm discussed an explanation was given of how the algorithm works as well as the various characteristics that make the algorithm unique.

<P>
For each algorithm, a brief overview of studies using the particular algorithm was given as well as some of the disadvantages or challenges that would be faced when applying the particular algorithm to the <#3092#>FAP<#3092#>.

<P>
The first algorithm discussed was the tabu search algorithm and the second was the simulated annealing algorithm. The chapter concluded with the genetic algorithm. 

<P>
In the table~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#tab:summary1#3093><tex2html_cr_mark></A>, the algorithms discussed in this chapter and their performance on the <#3094#>COST<#3094#> 259 set of benchmarks have been summarised.
