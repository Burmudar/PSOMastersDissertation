Introduction</A>

Metaheuristics is a subdomain of the <#2421#>AI<#2421#> domain[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It evolved out of a need for more efficient search techniques with regard to hard problems. 

<P>
Metaheuristics forms part of a collective body of algorithms that use heuristics to search a particular domain's search space for the most optimal solution[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Some problems explicitly define constraints to which the produced solution must adhere to. Problems that define such constraints are referred to as constraint optimisation problems[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Problems where there are either no constraints or just a boundary constraint  defined are referred to as unconstraint problems[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Constraints can be either hard or soft. A hard constraint is defined as a certain condition an algorithm or potential solution is not allowed to violate[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A soft constraint is allowed to be violated but there is some sort of penalty or cost involved which is imposed onto the potential solution, which lowers its desirability[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
An optimal solution would therefore be any solution that violates no hard constraints and violates no or a minimum number of soft constraints[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Algorithms that are classified as being part of the collective body of algorithms known as metaheuristic algorithms are Tabu Search[#TabuVechicleRoutingWithTimeWindows#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#TabuCSP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], Simulated Annealing [#SASingleMultiObj#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CurveFittingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] and Genetic Algorithm[#GATSP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GeostatisticalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The above-mentioned algorithms are not the only algorithms to form part of this subdomain, but they are the algorithms that have received the most attention in the literature and produce good results[#SweepMeta#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The main focus of this chapter is on each of the above algorithms. Before each of the algorithms is discussed, a brief overview is given of the various characteristics that metaheuristic algorithms exhibit. 

<P>
<#2433#>AI<#2433#> search algorithms operate in search spaces, where they occupy various states while they are searching for a solution or goal state in a search space. Before these algorithms can be properly introduced, the concept of search spaces and states needs to be introduced.

<P>
