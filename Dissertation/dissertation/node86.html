Initial Temperature</A>
</H3>
The initial temperature is a very important parameter to define in the <#2760#>SA<#2760#> algorithm, since it defines a point from which the cooling schedule will start[#VariousCoolingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore, depending on what the initial value of the temperature, is the final result that the algorithm will produce can be influenced[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AutoConfigSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
When the initial temperature is set to a very high value, the algorithm takes a long time to reach a result since the search space is being explored more[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#VariousCoolingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. More exploration is favourable for <#2764#>SA<#2764#> as it lets the algorithm be less susceptible to local minimum. 

<P>
If the initial temperature is set to a very low temperature, the algorithm might converge too quickly and thus produce a result which may be the local minimum[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#VariousCoolingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AutoConfigSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The initial temperature together with the cooling factor allows the algorithm designer to define the time window for the algorithm to escape local minima, as well as the rate of convergence to an optimum solution[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#VariousCoolingSA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A low initial temperature together with a low cooling factor makes the time window for the algorithm to leave a local optimum very small[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With a high initial temperature and cooling factor value that is almost 1, the time window for the algorithm to leave the local optimum is much larger [#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
When the algorithm is near a global optimum, a low initial temperature and low cooling factor will allow the algorithm to reach the optimum faster in the search space[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In contrast, if a high temperature and a very low cooling factor are used, the algorithm will take longer to reach the optimum even though it is near the global optimum[#SALongestCommon#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
