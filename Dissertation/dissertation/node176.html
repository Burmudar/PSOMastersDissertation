The problem defined in this dissertation is the frequency assignment problem (FAP). The problem where the problem was categorised as being part of the set of NP-Complete problems. The NP-Complete nature of the problem is an important concept to understand.

<P>
Within the FAP domain there exists are different techniques when assigning frequencies, discussed in section <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FreqAssignmentTypes#6773><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. 

<P>
The FAP is not just one problem but consists of various subproblems that have different goals for the resulting frequency plan. Some problems are concerned with the number of frequencies used, others are more concerned with the amount of interference that is generated on the network because of the assignment. The various FAP subproblems were outlined in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FAPVariants#6774><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
A formal mathematical definition of the MI-FAP was also given. Finally, the chapter concluded with the various benchmark problems which are used to test the viability of frequency assignment algorithms.
