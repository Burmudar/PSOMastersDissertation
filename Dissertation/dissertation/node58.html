Siemens4</A>
</H3>
The Siemens4 instance is similar to a <#2056#>gsm<#2056#> network that follows the <#2057#>gsm<#2057#>900 standard. According to this instance this network has been allocated 39 continuous frequencies starting at 56, thus <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math69#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15093#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. No frequencies are said to be globally or locally blocked in this network.

<P>
According to this problem instance this network has 276 sites and consists of 760 cells. Where each cell is said to have on average 3.66 transceivers. The Co-site separation is set to be two and the co-cell separation must be three.

<P>
In the next section a general overview is given on the different industries where the <#2058#>FAP<#2058#> is encountered. The purpose of this discussion is to get a better understanding about how far reaching the problem is and the different forms the problem is encountered in.
