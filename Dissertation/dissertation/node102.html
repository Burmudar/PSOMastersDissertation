Flow of the Algorithm</A>
</H2>
The core concepts of the genetic algorithm were introduced in the previous section. To better understand the algorithm, a general overview of the algorithm will be presented in this section using algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3003><tex2html_cr_mark></A> as a reference point.

<BR>
The <#3032#>GA<#3032#> algorithm is a population-based algorithm and therefore needs to initialise its population. Each individual of the population represents a potential solution. Population initialisation occurs in line 1 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3033><tex2html_cr_mark></A> on page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3034><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>. 

<P>
The amount of individuals in a population to be generated is predefined and is known as the population size. In algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3035><tex2html_cr_mark></A> on page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3036><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A> the population size is represented by the subscript <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15239#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# in <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15241#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#, where <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15243#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#.

<P>
Before the algorithm can start <I>evolving</I> its population, it first needs to determine each individual in the population's fitness. The fitness of an individual is calculated using a fitness function <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math74#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15245#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#.

<P>
After each individual within the initial population has been evaluated, the algorithm is able to start its searching process, which starts at line 3 and ends at line 17 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3039><tex2html_cr_mark></A> on page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3040><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>.

<P>
Since each individual has a fitness value after being evaluated, the selection operator is applied. The selection operator used on line 4 determine which individuals will form part of the parents used to generate offspring for the next population.

<P>
Once the selection operator has selected the parent individuals needed for the next population, the algorithm is ready to enter the reproduction phase, which ranges from lines 5 -- 17 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3041><tex2html_cr_mark></A> on page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3042><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>.

<P>
In the reproduction phase the crossover and mutation operators are applied probabilisticly. For the crossover operator a crossover probability is calculated on line 7. Depending if the calculated probability satisfies the crossover probability the crossover operator is applied on line 9. Depending on the crossover used, offspring are generated using one or more individuals as parents. The resulting offspring from the crossover operation is assigned to <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15247#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#.

<P>
On line 11 the value of <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15249#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is assigned to the variable <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15251#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# which represents the offspring. From lines 7 -- 11 it can be observed that a particular individual does not have to take part in a crossover operation to be carried over to the new population. Thus knowledge gained from the current population is persisted based on the crossover propbability.

<P>
The second step of the reproduction phase is where the mutation operator is applied. For each of the offspring a mutation probability is calculated. If the calculated probability for a particular offspring are high enough, the algorithm enters the mutation phase. In the mutation phase an individual is selected and the mutation operator is applied. Application of the mutation operator can be seen to occur in lines 13 -- 15 of algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3046><tex2html_cr_mark></A> on page~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:GA#3047><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>.

<P>
Regardless of whether the offspring has been mutated or not, the resulting offspring are added to the new population. The reproduction phase continually loops, until the new population equals the size of the initial starting population. Once the amount of individuals in the new population has reached the population size <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15253#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#, the algorithm moves on to its next iteration.

<P>
After the algorithm has completed the reproduction phase the algorithm selects the new population to be used in the next generation. The new population is selected from the current population and the created offspring.

<P>
The algorithm continually generates a new population for each generation until a predetermined stopping criterion has been met. Once the criterion has been met, the algorithm selects the individual with the best fitness in the current population as its most optimal solution. The following section discusses literature where the <#3048#>GA<#3048#> has been applied to the <#3049#>FAP<#3049#>.
