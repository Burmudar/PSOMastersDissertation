Introduction
</H2>
PSO is population-based stochastic search technique that was developed by Kennedy and Ebenhart in 1995 [#PSOGABreeding#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The basic model of the algorithm is based on simulations done to recreate the natural behaviour of a flock of birds [#PSOSoftTesting#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the early stages of the particle swarm development, simulations were developed to closely model the stigmergy (see page <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#4345><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A> for a discussion on stigmergy) exhibited when a flock of birds cohesively move as one and are able to suddenly change direction in a unpredictable, graceful manner, only to regroup as one observed entity [#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
As the ``leading'' bird of the flock changes its movements the information is shared with all birds in the immediate vicinity of the leading bird. As the information is shared locally among birds, each bird modifies his own movement to that of the leading bird's movement[#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Because birds obtain information by observing their neighbouring birds, the stigmergy can be deemed to be of a physical nature; therefore the particular stigmergy used by birds is sematectonic stigmergy (see page <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#def:sematectonic#4348><tex2html_cross_ref_visible_mark></A>).

<P>
The simulations based on this behaviour of the flock allowed researchers to discover the underlying patterns that governed the way birds are able to share information about the general movement of the flock. Based on these patterns and simulations, the particle swarm algorithm emerged into an optimisation algorithm [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the algorithm a particle is an individual[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A group of particles, referred to in the literature as a swarm,  are moved through the search space of the problem the algorithm is being applied to[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each particle changes its movement based on information shared with it by neighbouring particles in the swarm [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
As information is shared among particles, the success of one particle ripples through the rest of the swarm and each particle is able to utilise shared information that leads to success of another particle. Thus, each particle's own personal experience and knowledge of the search space has an effect on its neighbouring particles [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Two variants of the initial <#4354#>PSO<#4354#> algorithm were developed namely the global <#4355#>PSO<#4355#> and local <#4356#>PSO<#4356#>. The only difference between the two algorithms is how they go about sharing information with the rest of the swarm. The sharing models of these two algorithms along with other sharing models are discussed in the <#4357#>PSO<#4357#> characteristics subsection [#SOSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the swarm, each particle is a potential solution that is represented by a D-dimensional vector [#PSOHybridJobShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#PSOSelfHierarch#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As a particle moves through the search space, it continually evaluates its current position and adjusts it accordingly to move in the general direction of its own personal best position and the position of the best particle in its neighbourhood. 

<P>
A particle evaluates its current position by using a heuristic function, or in more evolutionary algorithm terms, a fitness function. The fitness value indicates to the particle how far it is from an optimal position[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
As a particle moves through the search space it keeps a memory of the personal best position it has achieved since the start of the algorithm. In the literature and in the algorithm this personal best position is referred to as <I>pbest</I> [#SOSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Most of the research done on <#4363#>PSO<#4363#> has focused on the convergence of the algorithm as well as improving the diversity [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Some of these improvements and modifications is discussed in the subsection on <#4365#>PSO<#4365#> characteristics.

<P>
