NP-Complete
</H1>
The term NP stems from the field known as complexity analysis. Algorithms are typically measured for their worst running time using <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14934#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# notation. The field of complexity analysis is more interested in measuring complexity of a problem than the running time of an algorithm[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The field of complexity analysis makes a keen distinction between problems that can be solved by algorithms in polynomial time and problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time using any available algorithm[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. An algorithm is said to be of polynomial time if the number of steps it needs to perform to solve the problem is given by <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14936#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# where <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14938#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# is a nonnegative integer and <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14940#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# refers to the complexity of the input[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A distinction needs to be made between <I>finding</I> a possible solution and determining whether a result is a valid solution to an NP problem[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Verifying whether some result is indeed a solution to an NP problem is a quick operation[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Finding a solution through the use of an algorithm is what polynomial time refers to.

<P>
Algorithms that are able to solve problems in polynomial time have worst case running times of <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math49#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14942#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# and <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14944#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These classes of problems are easy to solve using modern algorithms available today. Problems that can be solved with these kind of running times are classified as being in the P range of complexity problems[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Another range of problems consists mostly of problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Hence, if an algorithm were to try each and every possible solution, it would take an arbitrarily long time, which cannot be determined, which is why these problems also have the characteristic of being non-deterministic[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Problems in this range are referred to as being in the NP range of complexity problems[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
There is another range of NP problems that are a subset of NP problems, which are referred to as the ``most extreme'' problems within NP.  These problems are collectively known as NP-Complete problems and are the most difficult problems to determine feasible solutions for in the NP problem range[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1542#>FAP<#1542#> is one such problem [#AndreasPaper#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FixedFAPPSO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
