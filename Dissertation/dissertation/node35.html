GSM Channels
</H1>
<#962#>gsm<#962#> defines a series of logical channels, which are used for communication over these interfaces. A distinction needs to be made between channels and frequencies. As discussed earlier, a network is licensed in a certain section of the wireless spectrum for use for commercial communication. This piece of spectrum is referred to as bandwidth and is measured in Hz, therefore <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14914#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# Hz, where <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14916#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# denotes the allocated bandwidth[#FundamentalsWirelessCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This bandwidth W is then divided into N smaller chunks of bandwidth called narrowband chunks. Each N narrowband chunk is a channel and has a width of <tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline14918#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# Hz[#FundamentalsWirelessCommunication#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Using <#965#>TDMA<#965#> the <#966#>gsm<#966#> system is able to provide additional transmission capacity by dividing the frequency into eight equal timeslots [#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As can be observed from figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:GSMChannels#968><tex2html_cr_mark></A> each <#969#>TDMA<#969#> frame has a series of consecutive timeslots. Each timeslot can be used for both uplink and downlink transmission. A <#970#>gsm<#970#> <I>channel</I> is a logical channel and refers to a single timeslot within a <#972#>TDMA<#972#> frame [#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

The <#1131#>gsm<#1131#> system is therefore able to use the same physical frequency in eight different timeslots without interference as these <I>logical</I> channels are used at different times. Therefore using <#1133#>TDMA<#1133#> the available channels that can be used for communication in <#1134#>gsm<#1134#> are increased eightfold [#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Frequencies are assigned to the uplink and downlink portion of the connection with a duplex separation of 45 Mhz in the frequency band to avoid interference between uplink and downlink. There are two types of channels, traffic channels and control channels. <#1136#>TCH<#1136#> primary purpose is to enable communication of user speech and data and therefore carry no control information [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A <#1138#>TCH<#1138#> is assigned to an <#1139#>MS<#1139#> device when the device indicates that it needs to communicate with another device either with speech or data. When an <#1140#>MS<#1140#> has finished with the <#1141#>TCH<#1141#> the allocated <#1142#>TCH<#1142#> is reclaimed for use by other <#1143#>MS<#1143#> devices on the network. This request by the <#1144#>MS<#1144#> device occurs using the control channels [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Control channels are much more actively used in a <#1146#>gsm<#1146#> network since they are the primary means by which control and management of the network occurs [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These channels are used even when the <#1148#>MS<#1148#> has no active connection and is in idle mode. This constant activity on the control channels is to keep the network updated with information such as the position of the <#1149#>MS<#1149#> (location updating) and signal strength [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The control channels are divided into three main channel groups namely <#1151#>BCH<#1151#>, <#1152#>CCCH<#1152#> and <#1153#>DCCH<#1153#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each of these channel groups contains other channels that aid in the control and management of the network. Each group along with the associated channels will now be briefly discussed.

<P>
The first group, <#1155#>BCH<#1155#>, consists of three channels:
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1429#><B><#1157#>BCCH<#1157#></B><#1429#> --- This channel is broadcast using the very first frequency assigned to a cell. Using this frequency, the channel broadcasts information regarding the network. This information includes radio channel configuration of the current and neighbouring cells, synchronisation information, registration identifiers and most importantly the format of the <#1158#>CCCH<#1158#> used by the local <#1159#>BTS<#1159#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1430#><B><#1161#>FCCH<#1161#></B><#1430#> --- Synchronisation information is broadcast to the <#1162#>MS<#1162#>to enable them to perform frequency correction on the transmission. Typical synchronisation information on this channel, for instance, is the exact frequency the local <#1163#>BTS<#1163#> is using for transmission to enable the <#1164#>MS<#1164#>to attune themselves to the same frequency [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1431#><B><#1166#>SCH<#1166#></B><#1431#> --- On this channel, identifying information regarding the <#1167#>BTS<#1167#> is transmitted. Also on this channel information regarding synchronisation of frames is sent which aids an <#1168#>MS<#1168#> to, for example, structure the time frames of <#1169#>TDMA<#1169#> frames.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The <#1171#>FCCH<#1171#> and <#1172#>SCH<#1172#> are always broadcast with the <#1173#>BCCH<#1173#> since these channels are needed for the operation of the radio subsystem [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1175#>CCCH<#1175#> is a point-to-point signalling channel that is used to localise an <#1176#>MS<#1176#> through the use of paging[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
When a <#1178#>MS<#1178#> is paged in a <#1179#>gsm<#1179#> network, a <#1180#>CCCH<#1180#> message is sent to all the cells in the surrounding area of the last known cell the <#1181#>MS<#1181#> was recorded to be at[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The messsage is sent to surrounding cells in case the <#1183#>MS<#1183#> changed location since it was last communication with the network[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1185#>MS<#1185#> recevies the paging through the <#1186#>CCCH<#1186#> and responds if it is intened for the particular MS[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The channel is also used to assign dedicated channels [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1189#>CCCH<#1189#> is made up of the following channels:
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1432#><B><#1191#>RACH<#1191#></B><#1432#> --- The <#1192#>RACH<#1192#> forms the uplink portion of the <#1193#>CCCH<#1193#> and is randomly accessed by the <#1194#>MS<#1194#>to request a dedicated channel for a single signalling transaction [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1433#><B><#1196#>AGCH<#1196#></B><#1433#> --- The <#1197#>AGCH<#1197#> froms the downlink part of the <#1198#>CCCH<#1198#>. It is used by the radio subsystem to assign a <#1199#>SDCCH<#1199#> or <#1200#>TCH<#1200#> to an <#1201#>MS<#1201#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1434#><B><#1203#>PCH<#1203#></B><#1434#> --- The <#1204#>PCH<#1204#> also forms part of the downlink portion of the <#1205#>CCCH<#1205#>. This channel is used by the radio subsystem to page specific <#1206#>MS<#1206#>, which aids in the process of locating an <#1207#>MS<#1207#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1435#><B><#1209#>NCH<#1209#></B><#1435#> --- This channel is used to inform an <#1210#>MS<#1210#> of any incoming group calls or calls that are being broadcast [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The last group of signalling channels is referred to as <#1213#>D/ACCH<#1213#>. This group of channels has the characteristic that they are a group of bidirectional point to point channels [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1436#><B>Stand-alone dedicated control channel (<#1216#>SDCCH<#1216#>)</B><#1436#> --- This channel is used for communication between the <#1217#>BSS<#1217#> and <#1218#>MS<#1218#> even when there is no active connection[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Hence the `stand-alone' since it means that there need not be a <#1220#>TCH<#1220#> assigned for communication to occur between the <#1221#>BSS<#1221#> and <#1222#>MS<#1222#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1437#><B><#1224#>SACCH<#1224#></B><#1437#> --- When a <#1225#>TCH<#1225#> or <#1226#>SDCCH<#1226#> is assigned, an accompanying <#1227#>SACCH<#1227#> is also assigned. The <#1228#>SACCH<#1228#> is used to transmit information for optimal radio operation, which can include information on power control of the radio transmitter and synchronisation information[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Packets must be continuously sent over the <#1230#>SACCH<#1230#> as it is used as proof that there is still a physical radio connection [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When the <#1232#>MS<#1232#> has finished using the <#1233#>SACCH<#1233#> channel, it transmits a report regard the current results of the radio signal level, which is continuously measured [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
  
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#1438#><B><#1235#>FACCH<#1235#></B><#1438#> --- When more bandwidth is required for signalling purposes, the signal of the <#1236#>TCH<#1236#> is modified using dynamic pre-emptive multiplexing. The additional bandwidth comes at the expense of the user data transport[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When a channel is created in this manner it is called a <#1238#>FACCH<#1238#> [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Finally, one last channel is defined namely the cell <#1241#>CBCH<#1241#>, which shares the same physical channel that the <#1242#>SDCCH<#1242#> uses. On this channel messages of the short message service cell broadcast are broadcast[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In this section an overview was given of how <I>logical</I> channels are used for communication between an <#1245#>MS<#1245#>  and <#1246#>BSS<#1246#>/<#1247#>MSC<#1247#>. These three groups of channels collectively enable the <#1248#>gsm<#1248#> network to facilitate wireless communication, a very important function for a telecommunication network. The following section dealts with how the network is able to keep a connection to an <#1249#>MS<#1249#> alive and allow the <#1250#>MS<#1250#> to make calls while the device is moving around geographically within the network.
