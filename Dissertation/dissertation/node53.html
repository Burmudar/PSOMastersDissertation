In 1994 <#2026#>EUCLID<#2026#> introduced a project called CALMA, which was a combined effort by several European governments that were part of <#2027#>EUCLID<#2027#> to investigate algorithms for military applications[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The project was granted to six research groups. Within the project 36 instances were made available by the <I>Centre d'ELectronique de l'ARmement</I> (CELAR) for radio link frequency assignment [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
All the CELAR instances have the constraint that the difference between frequencies assigned to interfering radio links must be greater than a certain predefined distance in the frequency domain[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This is a soft constraint and may be violated. Another constraint in the CELAR instances is that each pair of parallel links must differ by an exact predefined distance[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This constraint is a hard constraint and may not be violated [#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
These instances were initially not available to the general public as they were contained to be within the CALMA project[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In 2001 the CELAR launched the International ROADEF challenge, where certain instances from the CALMA project were made available for the research teams taking part in the challenge[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The instances made available had been modified to take polarisations and controlled relaxations of certain EMC constraints [#LowerPolarFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
