Algorithm Efficiency</A>

The <#2996#>GA<#2996#> is a powerful, yet simple algorithm and tends to find good solutions given enough time, it does have its disadvantages. One of the major disadvantages occurs when the <#2997#>GA<#2997#> is applied to problems that have very large solution spaces. In these problems, the population size is a very sensitive parameter[#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#HetergeneousGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#SelfAdaptiveDataMiningGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#PatternDetectionGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. If the population is too small the algorithm will not have enough diversity to search and will tend to converge prematurely. 

<P>
A large population is preferred in large search spaces in order to get good chromosome diversity among individuals. Hence, the population size must be fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance in large search spaces [#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Note an increase in population does not guarantee good chromomsome diversity among the population. As discussed in initial populaiton generation it is also dependant on the random generation scheme used as well. 

<P>
In the next section the pseudo code for the <#3000#>GA<#3000#> algorithm is presented and the flow of the <#3001#>GA<#3001#> algorithm is discussed
