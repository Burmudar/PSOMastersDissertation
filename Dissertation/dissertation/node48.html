Minimum Span Frequency Assignment Problem</A>
</H2>
The <#1896#>MS-FAP<#1896#> is a problem that is very relevant today, especially when network operators want to deploy a new network in a region[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#1898#>MS-FAP<#1898#> is concerned with keeping the interference below a certain level during assignment as well as minimising the span[#MSFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The interference threshold used is specified by the network designer as the minimum allowable interference on the network[#MSFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The span is defined as an interval on the frequency domain. This interval is the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies used during assignment[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MSFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With the span value, network operators are able to request certain frequency bands and know their network will be able to operate at suitable interference levels [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MSFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#1903#>MS-FAP<#1903#> and <#1904#>MO-FAP<#1904#> are two very similar problems, the only difference being that <#1905#>MO-FAP<#1905#> focuses on minimising different frequencies and <#1906#>MS-FAP<#1906#> focuses on minimising the interval of frequencies used during assignment [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The Philadelphia benchmark is usually used to gauge how well the algorithm performs.
