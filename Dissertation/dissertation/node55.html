Siemens1</A>
</H3>
The Siemens1 instance resembles a <#2048#>gsm<#2048#> network that follows the <#2049#>gsm<#2049#>900 standard. This particular network has been allocated a spectrum set of frequencies <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math61#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15074#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# which are allowed to be assigned to cells. 

<P>
Not all 74 frequencies are available to be used by the network. The allocated frequency block is split into two blocks. According to the problem instance frequencies ranging from <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math62#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15076#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# are globally blocked. Only frequencies ranging from <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math63#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15078#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# and <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math64#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15080#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# therefore available for assignment.

<P>
This problem instance finally also defines this network as consisting of a total of 506 cells where on average each cell has 1.84 transceivers that need to be assigned a frequency. The co-site separation is stated to be two and the co-cell separation is stated to be three.
