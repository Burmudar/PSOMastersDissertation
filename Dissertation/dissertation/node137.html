Neighbourhood topolgies</A>
</H3>
The neighbourhood topology (also called social structure) used by a <#4387#>PSO<#4387#> algorithm dictates how information is shared among the particles of the swarm. According to Engelbrecht[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] there are 6 neighbourhood topologies. Each topology will now be listed and a short description will also be given.
<DL>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4665#><B>star</B><#4665#> --- With the star topology all particles within a swarm are interconnected with each other. Any one particle can communicate with any other particle in the swarm[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Using this topology each particle is attracted towards the best solution found globally by the swarm[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4666#><B>ring</B><#4666#> --- Using the ring topology each particle communicates with its immediate adjacent neighbour[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Each particle aims to mimic the best solution found within its neighbourhood[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Neighbourhoods are allowed to overlap in the ring topology[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Overlapping allows for information sharing among neighbourhoods and facilitates the swarm in converging to a single solution[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4667#><B>wheel</B><#4667#> --- In the wheel topology there is a central particle with which all other particles in the swarm are connected to[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The other particles are isolated and can only share information with the central particle[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The central particle utilises information about all the particles in its neighbourhood and adjusts its own best position accordingly[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Depending on whether the new best position represents a better solution than previously, the central particle shares the information to its neighbours[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A consequence of the limited sharing that occurs in the wheel topology is that the propagation of good solutions through the swarm is slowed[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4668#><B>pyramid</B><#4668#> --- The pyramid topology interconnects particles so that their connected structure resembles a three-dimensional pyramid[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4669#><B>four clusters</B><#4669#> --- With this topology four clusters are formed. Each cluster containing interconnected particles[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Between each cluster there exists only two connections to other clusters[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
</DD>
<DT></DT>
<DD><#4670#><B>von Neumon</B><#4670#> --- Using this topology all particles are connected in a structure that resembles a grid[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This structure has been shown to enable the swarm to produce better results than other neighbourhood topologies[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Based on the neighbourhood topologies defined above the global <#4413#>PSO<#4413#> uses a star neighbourhood to allow for information to be shared all particles in the swarm. The particle whose position in the search space indicates the best solution found by the swarm is denoted as <I>gbest</I>[#SOSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
In contrast, the local <#4416#>PSO<#4416#> follows the process of natural birds more closely and uses the ring neighbourhood for information sharing[#SOSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Hence, particles only share information with their immediate neighbourhood and not with the whole swarm. The best particle in the local <#4418#>PSO<#4418#> is denoted as <I>lbest</I>[#SOSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
