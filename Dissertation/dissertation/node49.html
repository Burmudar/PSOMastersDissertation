Minimum Interference Frequency Assignment Problem</A>
</H2>
The <#1909#>MI-FAP<#1909#> or <#1910#>FS-FAP<#1910#> is encountered after the network operator has obtained a frequency band from a regulatory body[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Unlike the previous problems, in <#1912#>MI-FAP<#1912#> any available channel in the allocated band may be used even though it produces interference. The other problems are concerned with the frequencies used, even though they might be violating some constraints that incur a huge amount of interference[#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MultipleBinaryFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The interference value does not play a large role in their respective objective functions[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MultipleBinaryFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In <#1915#>MI-FAP<#1915#> the objective is to minimise the total amount of interference on the network. It is important to note that this amount of interference might not necessarily be zero [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#1917#>MI-FAP<#1917#> is the problem currently most encountered in cellular networks, since there are more operating networks than new networks being designed in the cellular industry today[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This particular problem forms the focus of this research. 

<P>
Since <#1919#>MI-FAP<#1919#> is very close to real-world instance problems, authors tend to use real-world instances or benchmarks to test the quality and efficiency of their algorithms [#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#MontemanniThesis#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The quality and efficiency of the solution in this research is benchmarked against the <#1921#>COST<#1921#> 259 benchmark ,which is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:FAPBenchmarks#1922><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
In the following section a formal mathematical definition for the fixed spectrum <#1923#>MI-FAP<#1923#> is set out. The definition is important as it forms the basis for the objective/cost function that the algorithm in this research uses.
