Population Size</A>
</H2>
As discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:swarm#6649><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the population parameter of the PSO is a sensitive parameter. For problems with big search spaces, it is better to have a large population. A large population increases diversity, meaning more particles occupy different positions in the problem space and hence the space is better explored, which internally increases the likelyhood of finding a better solution. Thus, in the results the population size was also varied.

<P>
In the results using a larger population did not significantly improve the possible solutions. In only one benchmark, namely Siemens2, the algorithm was able to produce a better possible solution than an algorithm that used a lower population size. In Siemens1, Siemens3 and Siemens4 the algorithm using a lower population was able to produce the best overall results.

<P>
Due to the complexity of the FAP it is difficult to use the PSO with a large population. The algorithm's efficiency greatly decreased with the increase in population, taking significantly longer to iterate through the same number of iterations as the algorithms with lower populations. The decrease in efficiency was not unexpected due to the function evaluations, movements and considerations increasing fivefold over the lower population size. What was unexpected was the degree to which the efficiency degraded.
