Introduction</A>
</H1>
The aim of this dissertation was to develop a modern artificial intelligence optimisation algorithm which would be applied to a problem in the cellular technology domain. This aim was achieved: an algorithm was developed based on the standard PSO algorithm which was then applied to operate on the FAP. 

<P>
In current research no similar PSO algorithm to date has been presented that has been applied to the FS-FAP using interference as a performance measurement. In chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#6749><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the innovation and new techniques that made it possible for an algorithm based on the PSO to operate in the FS-FAP domain were discussed.
