In this chapter results produced by the algorithm discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#6781><tex2html_cr_mark></A> were presented. The FAP PSO algorithm was applied to four COST 259 benchmarks namely Siemens1, Siemens2, Siemens3 and Siemens4. These four benchmarks were discussed in detail in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:fap#6782><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. For each of the benchmarks, 12 different variants of the FAP PSO algorithm were tested. Each variant used a different velocity function, global best selection scheme or population size. The chapter concluded with a critical analysis of each of the different algorithms developed for this dissertation to enable the PSO to operate in the FAP space.
