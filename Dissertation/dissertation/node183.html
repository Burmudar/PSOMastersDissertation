The Conclusion</A>
</H2>
In chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:psoapplicationFAP#6784><tex2html_cr_mark></A> new velocity methods were created to enable the PSO swarm to move around in the problem space. To further improve the performance of the PSO additional techniques were developed.

<P>
The additional techniques were mainly concerned with how the gbest for the swarm is selected. The algorithms for these methods and techniques were also listed in the chapter. Not all the techniques used in the FAP PSO were entirely new; some techniques that were used can be easily identified like the use of tabu lists. Other techniques are a bit more difficult to identify. The building of the gbest actually borrows a concept used by ants in the ACO algorithm to build solutions. 

<P>
The FAP PSO algorithm uses random collision resolution when a particle position is already in the tabu list. The random collision resolution works by randomly selecting a new channel until it is found not to be tabu. This procedure is very similar to the mutation operation used by the GA algorithm.

<P>
In chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:results#6785><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the results of the FAP PSO algorithm applied to the COST 259 Siemens benchmark were discussed. By critically evaluating the results one can conclude that the best performing PSO variant is the particular algorithm using the first developed velocity method, which utilises cells to build the global best. The results achieved by this variant of the algorithm greatly outweigh those of the other algorithms, but when compared with the best achieved in the literature the algorithm still has some way to go.

<P>
Being so far off the best achieved results in the literature is not surprising, as applying the PSO to the FS-FAP and to the COST 259 benchmark is a first. Nonetheless this research has shown that it is indeed viable to apply the PSO to the FS-FAP, and with more research it is possible that the PSO algorithm might be able to either come near the best presented results or actually improve upon them.
