Stigmergy
</H1>
Stigmergy is defined as the method used by animals and insects to facilitate indirect communication[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Through the use of stimergy animals or insects are able to socially interact with their own species to convey information to each other[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Interaction occurs through signals that the individuals receive which might require them to perform a specific action[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Two forms of stigmergy can be observed in nature. One form, <I>sematectonic stigmergy</I><A NAME="def:sematectonic"><tex2html_anchor_mark></A>, is a direct and physical form of interaction since it relies on altering the environment[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Examples of this type of stigmergy are nest building and brood sorting by ants[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Schools of fish also use this type of stigmergy to communicate direction and speed by visually observing their closest partner in the school. Besides using visual information, birds use sound to communicate with and alert each other[#SwarmArt#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The other form, <I>sign-based stigmergy</I>, is an indirect form of interaction, where communication occurs through some sort of signal mechanism[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Ants use sign-based stigmergy to communicate with each other. More on how ants communicate with this type of stigmergy is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:ACOverview#3772><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
Other species that use sign-based stigmergy are bees[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. When a bee determines that an entity poses a threat to the hive, it might decide to sting the entity. The sting of a bee not only injects a toxin into the entity, but also releases a pheromone[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This pheromone alerts nearby other bees from the hive of the presence of an entity that is a potential danger to the hive[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The other bees of the hive pick up this pheromone that is released by the initial bee's stinger and attack the entity by also stinging it[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As more bees sting the entity, more bee stingers emit the danger pheromone identifying the entity[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Hence the pheromone is reinforced and becomes stronger, which persuades more bees into action[#stigmergicoptimization#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Stigmergy is a powerful mechanism that is able to alter the behaviour of a collective entity efficiently, as can be gathered from the above-mentioned examples of stigmergy in nature[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Stigmergy is therefore a core concept upon which swarm intelligence algorithms are based as these communication techniques are exploited to aid the algorithm in finding better solutions[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In the forthcoming sections three swarm intelligence algorithms are discussed. Each section is divided into four subsections. 

<P>
First, an overview of the algorithm is given, where basic concepts about the algorithm are introduced as well as a general outline given of the search process the algorithm uses. 
The second subsection will give an in-depth discussion of some of the core characteristics that make the algorithm unique. 
The third subsection will provide a step-by-step discussion of the algorithm using pseudocode as a reference.

<P>
Finally, for each algorithm studies using the algorithm on the <#3781#>FAP<#3781#> are mentioned and the various considerations that need to be made to apply the algorithm to the <#3782#>FAP<#3782#> are identified.
