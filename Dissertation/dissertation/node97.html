Selection Operator</A>
</H3>
The selection operator is the first operator to be applied to the population after each generation. The operator determines which individuals will be used to create offspring [#CoactiveFuzzyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CombinedBranchBoundGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The individuals are selected based on the selective pressure and are moved to the ``mating pool''. Individuals that are selected by selection operator are used by the crossover and mutation operators (in the reproduction phase), to generate offspring from the mating pool[#AdaptiveSAGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AcceleratingGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
By favouring high fitness individuals above low fitness individuals the operator is said to have a high selective pressure[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Care must be taken if the operator uses a high selective pressure. Since high fitness individuals are preferred, diversity among the individuals in the population will deteriorate and thus result in premature convergence[#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
If the search space is known to have only one optimum, then a high selection pressure is feasible[#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The selection operator directs the search into a gradient-based direction that converges on a single optimum solution [#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
In contrast, with a search space that is known to have multiple optima a low selection pressure is more benificial to the <#2934#>GA<#2934#>[#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Low selection pressure allows the population of the <#2936#>GA<#2936#> to explore the search space more[#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The means by which the selection operator selects individuals is referred to as the selection scheme. The most widely adopted selection scheme is known as the <I>roulette wheel</I> selection scheme [#ConstrainedGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GeostatisticalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#HybridBaldwinGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CoactiveFuzzyGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With this scheme an individual is selected based on a probability defined by the fitness of the individual divided by the collective fitness of the population [#GeostatisticalGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Depending on how complicated the objective function is and how large the population is, the selection phase may be the most computationally expensive as well as time consuming [#AcceleratingGA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The selection process as described below  can also be applied by the crossover operator. This process was opted to be split from the crossover operator as to provide a better overview of how the algorithm works

<P>
After the offspring has been generated, a selection operator is applied again[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The purpose of this selection operator is to determine the population of the next generation[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Within this selection process replacement policies can <I>optionally</I> be applied[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
These replacement policies define which individuals of the current population should be replaced by the newly generated offspring[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. For instance, the policy can define that the entire current population should be replaced by the offspring[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Using this policy is not ideal as some generated offspring could have much worse fitness than their parents but due to the replacement the solutions represented by the good parents are lost[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Other replacement policies include replacing the worst individual in the current population with offspring on the premise that the offspring has a better fitness[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By replacing older chromosomes with better performing chromosomes in the population replacement strategy, the <#2950#>GA<#2950#> achieves an hill-climbing ability.
