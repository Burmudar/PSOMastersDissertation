A Brief History of GSM Networks
</H2>
In early 1981 a group known as the <I>Groupe Speciale Mobile</I> was established to develop a Europe-wide radio communication system using the reserved 900 MHz band<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot591"><SUP>2.1</SUP></A>
<P>
At the start of the <#448#>gsm<#448#> specification in the early 1980s it was initially thought that the system would be analogue based, but this soon changed with the <#449#>ISDN<#449#> specification nearing completion[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As such the <#451#>gsm<#451#> specification started following many of the same design principles and access protocols that <#452#>ISDN<#452#> exhibited[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
After the completion of the <#454#>ISDN<#454#> specification, the advantages of switching to digital instead of analogue for communication became clear[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] One of the primary advantages of <#456#>ISDN<#456#> is that it is capable of transmitting data at higher speeds[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] <#458#>gsm<#458#> would therefore be based on digital transmission and speech would be represented by a digital stream of 16 kbits/s [#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Before the switch to digital transmission was finalised the Groupe Speciale Mobile first wanted to evaluate the spectral efficiency of analogue and digital-based transmission[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Spectral efficiency plays an important part in wireless communication since the radio spectrum is a limited resource and whichever transmission technology is used, the utilisation of the spectrum should be maximised[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Maximum utilisation is an important problem that is discussed in detail in later sections of this chapter. After an evaluation of spectral efficiency it was decided that the <#462#>gsm<#462#> system would be digitally based using <#463#>TDMA<#463#> [#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. <#465#>TDMA<#465#> is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:interfacech#466><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
By the early 1990â€™s <#467#>gsm<#467#> became an evolving standard and the first <#468#>gsm<#468#>-based network was demonstrated in 1991<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot592"><SUP>2.2</SUP></A>[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The following year a number of <#472#>gsm<#472#> networks were operating in Europe due to mobile terminals and equipment capable of operating on the networks becoming more widely available to the general public[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In the same year an operator in Australia became the first non-European operator to implement a <#474#>gsm<#474#>-based network[#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The collective subscriber base of <#476#>gsm<#476#> networks surpassed the million subscriber mark in 1993[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Due to this phenomenal growth in <#478#>gsm<#478#> network use, numerous extensions were made to the <#479#>gsm<#479#> specification. 
Some of the extensions that were made are the following[#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

<UL>
<LI>Half rate speech codec
</LI>
<LI>Improved SMS
</LI>
<LI>Line identification
</LI>
<LI>Call waiting
</LI>
<LI>Call holding
</LI>
</UL>
The specification with these extensions is known as <#483#>gsm<#483#> Phase 2+. As the world shifted towards more digital and data-intensive services it became difficult to deliver these services over <#484#>gsm<#484#> networks. This difficulty was due to the restriction that data could only be transmitted at 9.6 kbps [#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
This restriction also applies to voice, as voice is encoded into data that is transmitted over the network[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSM92#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Before the extensions were made, voice was encoded using the Full Rate codec[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The Full rate codec was the first codec used to encode voice in the <#488#>gsm<#488#> standard and required the full 9.6 kpbs that was available[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With half rate speech telephony, only half of the 9.6 kpbs is required for the same voice quality to be delivered[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].  

<P>
The new specification defined new technologies such as GPRS, EDGE and HSCSD, which were designed with the primary goal of making more bandwidth available for data transmission [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Data transmission was improved by these technologies by enabling more than one <#492#>gsm<#492#> slot to be used for a terminal or service at a time[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
If more than one <#494#>gsm<#494#> slot is to be used by a terminal or service, transceivers are required to have a higher <#495#>SIR<#495#> ratio [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This requirement affects radio interfaces as there is a higher likelihood that interference might occur; hence it makes it more difficult to generate a low interference frequency plan [#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The actual <#498#>SIR<#498#> at a receiver is dependent on a number of factors that include [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]:

<UL>
<LI>Frequency used at the transceiver
</LI>
<LI>Strength of the signal
</LI>
<LI>Weather conditions
</LI>
<LI>Shape of the surrounding environment
</LI>
<LI>Direction of the transmission
</LI>
</UL>
Even taking these factors into account, the calculation of the <#502#>SIR<#502#> at a transceiver is not trivial. This calculation of the <#503#>SIR<#503#> as well as its impact on mobile radio frequencies is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:Interference#504><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
As the <#505#>gsm<#505#> standard matured as a cellular technology, industry experts began specification of the next generation of cellular networks, which would in time replace the <#506#>gsm<#506#> cellular system. 

<P>
The <#507#>UMTS<#507#> is considered the third generation (3G) of cellular networks[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. <#509#>UMTS<#509#> was designed from the beginning to operate in parallel with the legacy <#510#>gsm<#510#> system. The first standard of <#511#>UMTS<#511#> was issued in the beginning of 2000 and subsequently most modern networks are based on it or are migrating their networks to it[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
UMTS is a major improvement over the <#513#>gsm<#513#> in two areas, namely data transmission bandwidth and frequency planning due to <#514#>UMTS<#514#> utilising <#515#>DS-CDMA<#515#> and <#516#>WCDMA<#516#>[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The higher data transmission speed (2 Mb/s) can be attributed to <#518#>UMTS<#518#> using the <#519#>DS-CDMA<#519#> scheme[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The scheme also allows more users to be served than previous generations of networks[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
DS-CDMA and <#522#>WCDMA<#522#> sends data over a wide band spectrum of 5 MHz. The wider spectrum allows for more frequencies to be utilised and with more frequencies being available; the <#523#>FAP<#523#> is easier to solve compared to a <#524#>gsm<#524#> network[#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A more in depth discussion on how a range of spectrum is divided into frequencies for communication in <#526#>gsm<#526#> networks is discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:interfacech#527><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. <#528#>DS-CDMA<#528#> and <#529#>WCDMA<#529#> will not be discussed in depth as this discussion focusses on <#530#>gsm<#530#>. The interested reader is directed to [#tabuglobalplanning3g#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] and [#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] for more information.

<P>
<#533#>CDMA<#533#> is a technology primarily used in broadband systems[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Users do not gain access to only a small portion of the bandwidth, but rather use the entire band for the duration of a connection[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Users also do not gain exclusive access to the whole band, but instead share the usage of the bandwidth with other users simultaneously, hence the name <I>multiple access</I>[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
With <#538#>CDMA<#538#> a user's signal is not transmitted as its original signal. Instead the signal is spectrally spread over a multiple of its original bandwidth using a spreading factor [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The spreading factor fluctuates between values of 10 and 1 000 [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Using these spreading factors less interference and fewer disturbances are encountered because the broadband signal is generated from a narrowband signal [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
UMTS may be a major improvement, but its adoption does not spread very far from busy city centers where there is a large concentration of clients in a small geographical area[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The reason for this is that, as mentioned previously, <#543#>UMTS<#543#> caters for larger data usage and therefore more clients can be serviced simultaneously [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Most network operators do not implement entirely new backbone architecture for <#545#>UMTS<#545#><A NAME="UMTSGSMBackbone"><tex2html_anchor_mark></A> to operate on, but instead utilise the same backbone used for <#547#>gsm<#547#> and GPRS[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This not only extends the lifetime of previous infrastructure investment by the operator, but also builds upon the redundancy provided by the <#549#>gsm<#549#> network [#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus even with new technological improvements such as <#551#>UMTS<#551#>, <#552#>gsm<#552#> as a wireless technology is still used for communication and is therefore still relevant today[#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The most up-to-date cellular network technology is referred to as the fourth generation of cellular networks (4G)[#4GWirelessVid#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The purpose of 4G is to improve upon 3G and bring true broadband speeds that is delivered over the cellular network[#4GWirelessVid#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. There are currently two competing technologies that aim to provide 4G capabilities to cellular networks which is <#556#>LTE<#556#> and Mobile <#557#>WIMAX<#557#>[#4GWirelessVid#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Both technologies provide broadband speeds in the range of 14 - 40 MBits/s[#4GWirelessVid#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. According to the 4G standard both technologies cannot be considered as ``true'' 4G technologies as the standard defines that broadband speeds in excess of 100 Mbits/s must be provided to be considered true <#560#>LTE<#560#>[#4GWirelessVid#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In this section a brief overview on the history of the <#562#>gsm<#562#> network was presented. In the next section an explanation of the topology of <#563#>gsm<#563#> network is given. This will broaden the understanding of <#564#>gsm<#564#> networks.
