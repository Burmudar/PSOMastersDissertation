The Siemens2 problem instance describes a <#2051#>gsm<#2051#> network based on <#2052#>gsm<#2052#>900 and has 86 sites. The problem specifies that the network consists of 254 cells where each cell has on average 3.85 transceivers that need to be assigned frequencies.

<P>
For this problem, the network has been allocated two blocks of frequencies: one block of four frequencies ranging from <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math65#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15083#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# and a second block of frequencies ranging from <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math66#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15085#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000#. The frequencies allocated to the network have been split into two blocks because frequencies ranging from <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math67#<tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline15087#
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>mathend000# are globally blocked. Finally the problem specifies that the co-site separation must be set to two and the co-cell separation must be set to three.
