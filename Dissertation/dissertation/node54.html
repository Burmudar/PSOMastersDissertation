COST 259
</H2>
The <#2039#>COST<#2039#> 259 is a set of real-world <#2040#>gsm<#2040#> instances made available by the European Union. The instances are publicly available and can  be downloaded for free at http://fap.zib.de/ (FAP Web 2011). The website also contains the most recent results obtained by researchers using these instances[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The instances are difficult due to the large number of transmitters (900 - 4 000) that need to be assigned frequencies, with a relatively small number of spectrum of frequencies. The most important characteristic of these benchmarks are that they resemble real-world <#2042#>gsm<#2042#> network data. Due to these benchmarks' real-world applicability, they were selected as the main benchmarks to evaluate the algorithm presented in this dissertation.

<P>
More specifically this research concentrates on a small subset of the instances that are available, namely Siemens1, Siemens2, Siemens3 and Siemens4. In the paper by Montemanni and Smith [#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] the same subset of problems was used and to date their algorithm has produced some of the best results. 

<P>
As discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:chm#2044><tex2html_cr_mark></A> constraint handling mechanisms need to be used for problems like the <#2045#>FAP<#2045#>. Each of the Siemens benchmarks define a set of globally or locally blocked frequencies which are hard constraints. Due to this constraint one of the mechanisms that will be used in the algorithm to handle solutions violating this constraint is <I>to reject any solutions that is found to violate this hard constraint</I>. The characteristics of each instance will now be discussed.
