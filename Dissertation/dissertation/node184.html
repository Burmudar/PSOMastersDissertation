Most of the techniques developed for the FAP PSO, aim to stay true to the standard PSO algorithm. The next step is to hybridise the FAP PSO algorithm. A good candidate for hybridisation would be the GA as the algorithm naturally ``purifies'' results in finding the right genes that make up a good possible solution.

<P>
In the PSO a good entry point for the GA to be incorporated would be twofold. The first point would be to take a certain global best selected with the standard procedure and then mate it with successive global bests, with the offspring global best being a best for a future iteration. With this method the PSO is able to use the history of the algorithm from the start.

<P>
The second method takes a swarm of a certain iteration and then mates all the particles with each other for a certain number of iterations. This method can be seen as a means to clean the swarm of inefficient genes and could serve as an intensification phase for the algorithm.

<P>
Another point of interest is to disregard the PSO and rather try and produce an ABC algorithm on the FS-FAP. As mentioned, the ABC algorithm was not chosen for this research, since it is new and has not been applied to a wide variety of problems. 

<P>
By using some of the techniques developed in this research for instance the selection schemes, a viable ABC algorithm could be developed. The ABC algorithm is not that specific as to how new solutions are generated, as with the PSO which relies on vector mathematics, which allows an algorithm designer considerably more freedom.
