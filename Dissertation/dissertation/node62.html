In a military context the <#2088#>FAP<#2088#> is a very difficult problem to be solved due to its dynamic nature[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. During deployment, connections need to be established rapidly between nodes which guarantee that the nodes will stay static at locations. Usually nodes are military field phones or can be any transceiver device [#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Due to the nature of the problem the <#2091#>DFA<#2091#> scheme is used to allocate frequencies to nodes. The military <#2092#>FAP<#2092#> has the property that any of the nodes are mobile and can move at any moment to a new location, potentially interfering with another connection[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This property differs from the traditional <#2094#>FAP<#2094#> where the nodes that are allocated frequencies are stationary[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Two frequencies need to be assigned to each connection that is established, one for each direction of communication. These allocated frequencies must also differ by a certain distance in the frequency domain to prohibit alternating directions of communication from interfering[#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
A lot of literature can be found on Military field communication. This is due to two organizations CELAR and <#2097#>EUCLID<#2097#> making data available to various research groups and allowing them to develop algorithms for frequency assignment [#CALMA#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DynamicFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
