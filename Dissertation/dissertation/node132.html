Knowledge sharing</A>

--- As a food source becomes more popular due to its high nectar amount, more onlooker bees will select it. By selecting the food source the onlooker be will then proceed to search in its neighbourhood for better solutions. Therefore the bees are disregarding previously gained knowledge while searching for neighbouring sources on <I>other</I> food sources. If a food source represents a complete frequency plan, a previous food source a bee operated on might have had one or more cells that were assigned to their optimal frequencies. Due to the larger majority of the cells not being optimised, these <I>good</I> cells are overshadowed. Thus due to the <I>bad</I> cells overshadowing the good cells, the food source nectar amount becomes lower. As a consequence of the low nectar amount by the food source the bees abandon the food source and those optimal cells are lost.

The above obstacles present real relevant challenges that would require new techniques to be developed. As the algorithm has not been applied to a wide variety of problems and taking into account the above obstacles, it is difficult to gauge if the <#4334#>ABC<#4334#> is well suited to be applied. The algorithm first needs to be applied to a wider set of problems. Once the algorithm has matured in the research behind it the algorithm can be revisited and applied to the <#4335#>FAP<#4335#>.

In this section the various obstacles one would encounter when applying the <#4336#>ABC<#4336#> class of algorithms to the <#4337#>FAP<#4337#> were identified. This concludes the discussion on the <#4338#>ABC<#4338#> algorithm. The next section deals with the particle swarm optimisation algorithm.
