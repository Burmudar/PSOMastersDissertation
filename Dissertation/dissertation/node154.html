Summary</A>
</H1>
In this chapter an algorithm was presented based on the standard particle swarm optimisation algorithm to operate on the frequency assignment problem encountered in cellular networks.

<P>
At the beginning of the chapter it was explained how a frequency plan is represented by the algorithm for use internally. Reasons were given for choosing the particular representation in the algorithm.

<P>
One of the most important phases of the <#5871#>PSO<#5871#> algorithm is velocity calculation. The problem was outlined as to why the standard velocity calculation was unsuitable for the <#5872#>FAP<#5872#>. The customised velocity calculation used by the algorithm developed in this research was presented along with suitable pseudocode.

<P>
The chapter concluded with small additions made to the algorithm to improve performance and, most important of all, improve solution quality.
