Summary
</H1>
In this chapter three swarm intelligence algorithms were discussed. The general flow of the ant colony optimisation algorithm was described with the help of a pesudo code as well as how the algorithm came about. The defining characteristics of the algorithm were identified and a literature review was given of the <#4632#>ACO<#4632#> being applied to the <#4633#>FAP<#4633#>.

<P>
The second swarm intelligence algorithm was the artificial bee colony optimization algorithm. How the algorithm was developed and how it performs its search in a problem space were explained. A diagram also outlined the general flow of the <#4634#>ABC<#4634#> algorithm.

<P>
A series of defining characteristics was explained. Each characteristic is a defining attribute of the algorithm that makes it unique with regard to other algorithms. No literature is available on the algorithm being applied to the <#4635#>FAP<#4635#> since to date no research has been conducted on such an <#4636#>ABC<#4636#> algorithm.

<P>
This chapter concluded with the most important algorithm, which is used in this dissertation on the <#4637#>FAP<#4637#>, namely the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The flow of the <#4638#>PSO<#4638#> algorithm was described in algorithm~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#alg:PSO#4639><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. Furthermore, characteristics that make the algorithm unique were explained, and a literature review was given of the <#4640#>PSO<#4640#> algorithm being applied to the <#4641#>FAP<#4641#>.
