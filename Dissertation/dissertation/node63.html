The <#2100#>FAP<#2100#> encountered in broadcasting very closely resembles the problem domain found in cellular networks[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The only notable difference is that the required distance by which allocated frequencies must differ in the frequency domain are larger in broadcasting than in cellular networks [#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Since the problem resembles the problem found in cellular networks, there are few articles that specifically discuss frequency assignment in broadcasting as a main topic. Research that specifically discusses <#2103#>FAP<#2103#> in broadcasting has been conducted by Idoumghar and Schott [#RadioFAP#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
