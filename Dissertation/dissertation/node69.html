  HREF="footnode.html#foot3109"><SUP>4.1</SUP></A> problems have been proven to not be solvable in polynomial time by traditional uninformed search algorithms such as Breath First Search and Depth-First Search[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
Uninformed algorithms are not able to distinguish whether a particular goal state is more ``correct'' than any other goal state[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Uninformed search algorithms search spaces are represented by a tree structure[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A search is performed in the search space by starting at a root node, the algorithm expands successive nodes based on a strategy[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Bread-first search continiously expands all successive nodes and Depth-First search expands the deepest node first[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The path taken to a final  goal state node represents a solution[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In a worst-case scenario, an uninformed search will expand every single node in its search space, thus each and every single possible solution is evaluated[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
It is not always viable to test every possible solution in a given problem search space, especially in NP-Complete problems, since their search spaces are huge or infinite. This is why traditional algorithms are not able to produce optimal solutions in polynomial time[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Metaheuristic algorithms are considered to be <I>general-purpose</I> algorithms and can thus be applied to a wide variety of optimisation problems with only small modifications that need to made to the algorithm model[#MetaGraph#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Metaheuristic algorithms do not dictate all aspects of the search procedure but define guidelines and aspects which directs the search[#HandbookofMH#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore a metaheuristic can be defined as follows: <I>the algorithm selects candidate solutions from a neighbourhood with respect to one or more current solutions of which the candidates are either rejected or accepted</I>[#HandbookofMH#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
As can be gathered from the name, a metaheuristic algorithm uses some sort of heuristic. A heuristic is a decision rule. Algorithms use heuristics to make decisions by applying the heuristic to the data the algorithm is currently working on[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
When an algorithm utilises a heuristic its forms part of a group known as informred search algorithms. As the name implies the algorithm is more ``informed'' using the heuristic the algorithm gains additional information about its search space. With this additional information the algorithm is able to performa a better search for a possible solution[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Heuristics are strategies that direct the search based on the information available, to move towards areas where there is a higher probability of obtaining high quality candidate solutions [#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A heuristic is able to dictate what an algorithm must do for its next iteration by evaluating the current internal state of the algorithm, i.e. whether it should move to a different point in the search space, generate new data, or select the current data as the most optimal solution[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
In general ``meta'' means <I>beyond</I> or <I>higher level</I>[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A metaheuristic therefore refers to a heuristic that is more complex with regard to the decisions it is able to make compared with a standard heuristic[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With a standard heuristic only the current state is considered[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A metaheuristic takes additional information into account when considering a current state[#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This additional information can be previous states, or states that are considering to be close in the search space[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#NatureInspiredMetaHeuristic#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Metaheuristic-based search algorithms are not guaranteed to find the most optimal solutions in the search space; instead these algorithms are used to find near-optimal solutions. Thus most algorithmic development in the metaheuristic domain focuses on developing new techniques that will increase the probability that a good solution will be obtained in difficult combinatorial problems [#MetaAgricultural#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Similarly, metaheuristics are not guaranteed to find suitable solutions or perform well in each problem domain it is applied to. The quality of the solution and performance of the metaheuristic is very much dependent upon on the expertise of the algorithm designer [#AutoComplexMeta#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Besides the algoritm designer modifying the algorithm; metaheuristic algorithms that are inherently population-based, hybrid and/or distributed, use the concept of social and self-organisation to better exploit the solution space[#Self-AdaptiveMeta#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
In this section the characteristics of metaheuristics that set these algorithms apart from the conventional algorithms used on difficult problems was introduced. In the next section of this chapter the tabu search algorithm is discussed.
