Introduction</A>
</H1>
 Wireless technology is used by modern electronic devices to establish communication over which information is exchanged[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Wireless technology facilitates communication between two devices by transmitting data or voice via a radio frequency[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Examples of devices exchanging information wirelessly are radios for audio entertainment; television remotes to change channels; cellular phones for communication; wireless access points to create wireless LANs[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The popularity and rapid adoption of wireless technology contributes to the difficulty of planning, managing and operating wireless networks[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As the popularity and use of services that use wireless technology increase, the need for these services to use different radio frequencies to communicate becomes greater[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This need arises due to an effect called <I>interference</I>, which occurs when two or more connections between devices use the same radio frequency to facilitate communication[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. This effect is discussed in more detail in chapter 3.

<P>
A wireless cellular operator is not allowed to operate on just any frequency. A governing body licenses a certain piece of the available wireless spectrum to the operator for use in their network[#FAPRAMColouring#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. These frequencies that need to be licensed for use are known as <I>commercial</I> frequencies and are very scarce as it is immensely expensive to license[#FAPRAMColouring#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The use of frequencies by services must be carefully considered to avoid interference when devices communicate with each other. This is a problem as the amount of devices that communicate far outstrips the amount of frequencies available for communication[#wirelesstelcoMullet#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Thus assigning frequencies to devices for communication is a difficult problem and is referred to as the <#410#>FAP<#410#>[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Initially manual techniques were used to assign frequencies in an attempt to solve the <#412#>FAP<#412#>[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As a result, assigning frequencies was either too complex or just too daunting because of the sheer number of devices that needed to be assigned frequencies[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Also, because of the rapid adoption of wireless technology the assignment of frequencies needed to be dynamic and hence automated[#Karen2004#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

By understanding how a <#416#>gsm<#416#> network operates, especially how communication is facilitated, the reader is able to understand the problem this dissertation addresses. Therefore, this chapter will start off with section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:GSMNet#417><tex2html_cr_mark></A> within which a brief history of <#418#>gsm<#418#> networks are presented. Section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:GSMArch#419><tex2html_cr_mark></A> follows the history discussion and presents an overview on the different architectural components the form a <#420#>gsm<#420#> network. In section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:gsminterfaces#421><tex2html_cr_mark></A> the different interfaces used by <#422#>gsm<#422#> network components for communication is presented. Section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:interfacech#423><tex2html_cr_mark></A> presents an overview on the logical channels that frequencies get divided into when used in a <#424#>gsm<#424#> network. Finally this chapter concludes with a discussion on the handover process in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:handover#425><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.
