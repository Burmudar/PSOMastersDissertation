Scout bee generation</A>
</H4>
--- When a food source is abandoned a scout bee needs to generate a new food source to take its place. In particular with the <#4329#>FAP<#4329#>, the newly generated solution cannot be completely random. The scout bee needs to incorporate knowledge already gained by the colony operating on different food sources, otherwise a completely random solution might not be even nearly lucrative enough for the rest of the bee colony to consider if it contains no knowledge gained by the algorithm.
