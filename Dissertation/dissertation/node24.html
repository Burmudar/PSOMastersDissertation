Mobile Station</A>

A <#570#>MS<#570#>  as it is defined in the <#571#>gsm<#571#> specification refers to any mobile device that is capable of making and receiving calls on a <#572#>gsm<#572#> network.  The <#573#>MS<#573#> is the main gateway 
for a user to gain access to the <#574#>gsm<#574#> network [#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Typical devices that fall under the category of <#576#>MS<#576#> are cellular phones, smart phones and <#577#>POS<#577#> devices. The <#578#>MS<#578#> has two features that play an important role throughout the <#579#>gsm<#579#> network, namely:

<DD>--- Inserted into a mobile device. The <#582#>SIM<#582#> contains the <#583#>IMSI<#583#> and is used throughout the network for authentication as well as being a key part in providing encrypted transmissions [#Eisenblatter#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

The <#688#>MS<#688#> has the capability to change the transmission power it uses from 0.8, 2, 5, 8 MW to a maximum value of 20 MW[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The change in transmission power is automatically set to the lowest level by the <#690#>BTS<#690#> to ensure reliable communication after evaluating the signal strength as measured by the <#691#>MS<#691#> [#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#GSMArchitectureProtocolsServices#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The power adjustment also minimises co-channel interference because the transmitted signal is less powerful and therefore less likely to interfere with other signals[#GSMSysEngin#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Co-channel interference is discussed in chapter~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#chpt:fap#694><tex2html_cr_mark></A>
