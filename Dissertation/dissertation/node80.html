Neighbourhood generation</A>
</H4>
--- The <#2658#>TS<#2658#> algorithm defines no set process for generating a neighbouring solution given a starting solution. Generating neighbours from a solution is a critical process in the <#2659#>TS<#2659#> algorithm, for it is the only means by which the algorithm considers other solutions, i.e. it is the mechanism by which the algorithm searches. Generating a new neighbour can be as simple as changing only one value from the current solution or it can be very complex and incorporate other algorithms together with mathematics formulae. Regardless of the complexity of the neighbour generation that is used, care must be taken to ensure that the algorithm is able to produce a wide diversity of neighbours and is also able to intensify on the most optimal solution.
