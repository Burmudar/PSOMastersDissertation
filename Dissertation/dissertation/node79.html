Search based on a single solution</A>
</H4>
--- The <#2654#>TS<#2654#> algorithm at any moment in time only searches in the vicinity of <I>one</I> current solution for possible neighbours that might be the current solution for the next iteration. <#2656#>FAP<#2656#>s have huge search spaces due to their NP-Complete nature. Therefore, only searching for possible rewarding neighbours from only potential solutions seems to be terribly inefficient. A better strategy would be to use the notion of population-based algorithms and have multiple solutions from which more rewarding neighbours are searched.
