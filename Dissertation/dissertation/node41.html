Constraint Handling mechanisms
</H1>
Not only is the <#1546#>FAP<#1546#> an NP-Complete problem but it is also a constraint problem. Constraint problem restrict the search space of possible solutions with boundaries. These boundaries are reffered to as constraints. The <#1547#>FAP<#1547#> domain has specific constraints defined for each of the different individual problems. Before the various ways in which frequencies can be allocated is discussed a brief discussion needs to be presented on constraint handling mechanisms.

<P>
Constraints define the boundaries of the search space. Solutions found to be violating the constraints are considered to be outside of the search space. Various methods exist how to treat solutions found to be outside of the defined search space. These methods are known to be <I>constraint handling mechanisms</I> and are discussed below.

<P>
In research done by Engelbrecht[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] the following constraint handling mechanisms are defined.

<UL>
<LI><#1626#><B>Reject infeasible solutions</B><#1626#> --- Solutions that violate the defined constraints are not even considered and rejected.
</LI>
<LI><#1627#><B>Penalty function methods</B><#1627#> --- Modifies the objective function to add a penalty that is enforced if a solution violates constraints. By adding a penalty the infeasible solutions are discouraged.
</LI>
<LI><#1628#><B>Convert the constrained problem to an unconstrained problem</B><#1628#> --- By solving the unconstrained problem better solutions can be found although not guaranteed.
</LI>
<LI><#1629#><B>Preserving feasibility methods</B><#1629#> --- Candidate solutions are initialised in the search space and satisfy all constraints. These solutions are continuously moved or transformed with specialised operators who ensure that the solutions continue to satisfy all the constraints. The operators ensure that all solutions stay within the bounded search space.
</LI>
<LI><#1630#><B>Pareto ranking methods</B><#1630#> --- Solutions are ranked based on the severity of their constraint violations.
</LI>
<LI><#1631#><B>Repair methods</B><#1631#> --- Operators are used to transform solutions that violate constraints to solutions that adhere to all the constraints and are thus feasible solutions.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Constraint handling methods need to be used when solving constrained problems like the <#1558#>FAP<#1558#>. Without these methods, the search for solutions is undirected and solutions that cannot be used are presented as most optimal. Reference to these methods will be made where applicable.

<P>
In the next section, two methods are discussed that define how frequencies are allocated.
