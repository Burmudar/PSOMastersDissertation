Tabu Search on the FAP</A>

In a study conducted by Robert Montemanni and Derek Smith [#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] the <#2620#>TS<#2620#> algorithm is used on the <#2621#>FS-FAP<#2621#>. The authors had to make some alterations to the algorithm to suit their needs as well as to make the algorithm more efficient in exploring in the <#2622#>FAP<#2622#> solution space.

<P>
The <#2623#>TS<#2623#> algorithm used by the authors is the multistart <#2624#>TS<#2624#> algorithm, which randomly starts on different initial solutions [#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The authors developed a technique called <#2626#>HMT<#2626#>. <#2627#>HMT<#2627#> first monitors an underlying heuristic being used on the problem by the algorithm[#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It then identifies certain characteristics that good solutions exhibit. In the <#2629#>FAP<#2629#>, it is transmitters that are assigned different frequencies which results in an overall lower interference value[#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The HMT then uses the identified characteristics to add <I>additional</I> constraints to the problem[#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By adding constraints, the search space is reduced. However, by reducing the search space, other near-optimal solutions which might be far better are excluded[#TabuMontemanniSmith#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It is for this reason that that Montemanni and Smith opted not to add the constraints permanently.

<P>
Montemanni and Smith applied their <#2634#>TS<#2634#> algorithm together with HMT to the <#2635#>COST<#2635#> 259 family of benchmarks, specifically the Siemens1, Siemens2, Siemens3 and Siemens4 problems. The results are presented in table~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#TSCOST259#2636><tex2html_cr_mark></A>. The values presented are scalar and indicate the total interference of the frequency plan. The lower the interference value is, the better the frequency plan.

As can be observed from the results obtained by the authors, the <#2649#>TS<#2649#> algorithm with HMT produces results that rank very favourably against other algorithms also applied to the <#2650#>COST<#2650#> 259.

<P>
When critically reasoning about the <#2651#>TS<#2651#> algorithm with regard to applying it to the <#2652#>FAP<#2652#>, the following disadvantages in theory can be identified:
