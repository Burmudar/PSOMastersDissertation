This chapter provides a discussion of the algorithm developed to be applied to the frequency assignment problem. Within this chapter an outline is given of the process in developing a specialised particle swarm algorithm for the frequency algorithm. Each specialised technique developed is discussed in depth, along with an explanation of why the technique is needed as well as why it is used by the algorithm.
