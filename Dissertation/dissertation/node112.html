Introduction
</H2>
ACO is a class of algorithms incorporating different behavioural aspects that ants exhibit when they perform certain activities, i.e. gather food, build nests and construct cemeteries[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The first <#3788#>ACO<#3788#> algorithms that were developed were based on the foraging behaviour that was exhibited by ants when finding the most optimal path towards a food source. Deneubourg noticed the foraging behaviour when he performed the bridge experiment [#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The bridge experiment outlined by Deneubourg placed a food source a certain distance away from the nest[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Two bridges of equal length were established towards the food resource. The ants initially selected a path randomly with no clear distinction of the more dominant path to take to retrieve food from the food source[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. After a finite amount of time, one of the paths to the food source became the preferred route for the ants even though both paths were of equal length. The preference of the one bridge by the ants is.

<P>
Deneubourg concluded that ants utilise pheromones to communicate to the rest of the foraging ants the shortest path towards a food source.[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] By using pheromones to communicate with other ants it can be concluded that ants use sign-based stigmergy (discussed in section~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:stigmergy#3793><tex2html_cr_mark></A>) when they retrieve food[#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. As the ant moves along a particular path, it marks the path with a chemical signal that alerts other ants to the desirability of the path [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The chemical signal that ants use to indicate optimal paths is called <I>pheromones</I>[#AntsAndStigmergy#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The bridge experiment was extended to have two bridges that differ in length. The extended bridge experiment is presented in figure~<A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#fig:antBridgeExperiment#3798><tex2html_cr_mark></A> and is known as the shortest path bridge experiement[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. In the experiment the ants started to prefer the shortest bridge [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The conclusion was made that the ants prefered the shorter bridge because ants return to the nest quicker and therefore the path is reinforced with pheromones faster than on the longer path[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Pheromones used by the ants in <#3809#>ACO<#3809#> go through two phases. The first phase is where pheromones a despoited on a particular path by an ant whether their exists previous pheromones or not. The second phase is where pheromones evapurate. Pheromones are not permenant and deteriorate over time[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. By letting pheromones evapurate, ants can ``forget'' previous desicions made by die colony[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. It can be concluded that the more pheromones evapurate the less influence the ants will have on their path selection, therefore promoting exploration[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The concept of pheromones and how the <#3813#>ACO<#3813#> proceeds in updating the pheromones is a critical concept of <#3814#>ACO<#3814#>. Hence, an in-depth discussion on pheromones is provided in subsection <A HREF=<tex2html_cr_mark>#sec:ACOcharacter#3815><tex2html_cr_mark></A>.

<P>
The <#3816#>ACO<#3816#> class of algorithms have a <I>core requirement</I> about the problem they are applied to[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The problem must be able to be modelled as a graph. The reason behind this requirement is that each individial ant in the <#3819#>ACO<#3819#> algorithm constructs a path through the graph[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The path constructed represents a solution.

<P>
A path through a graph is made up of a series of links between nodes[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DataStructuresJava#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A link between two nodes represents a movement from one node to the other[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DataStructuresJava#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Therefore, a path can be considered as the traversal of the interlinked nodes, from a starting node to some final node[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DataStructuresJava#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. A path differs from another path by the order in which the nodes are interlinked between a start and end node[#AIModernApproach#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#DataStructuresJava#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
The <#3825#>ACO<#3825#> class of algorithms has been applied to a wide range of problems that include single machine scheduling[#ACOSingleMachine#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#],weapon target assignment[#WeaponTargetACO#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#], flow shop scheduling[#ACOFlowShop#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#] and image thresholding[#ACOImageThreshold#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. Variants of the standard algorithm have been developed, but all of the algorithms still follow the core structure of the <#3830#>ACO<#3830#> algorithm[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].
The first algorithm developed based on the foraging behaviour of ants is known as the <#3832#>SACO<#3832#> and was proposed by Dorigo in 1992 [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The algorithm provided the basis for how pheromones are used and updated. The <#3834#>SACO<#3834#> is an algorithmic implementation of the double bridge experiment.

<P>
The first algorithm to improve upon the <#3835#>SACO<#3835#> is the <#3836#>AS<#3836#> [#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The <#3838#>AS<#3838#> included heuristic information into the probability that an ants chooses to move towards a node. The <#3839#>AS<#3839#> also added memory to the <#3840#>AS<#3840#> by using a tabu list and also incorporated pheromone evapuration. The improvements made enabled the <#3841#>AS<#3841#> to better explore the search space and produce better results[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. 

<P>
The <#3843#>AS<#3843#> algorithm has achieved relatively good success in the problems it has been applied to, but it does have some disadvantages[#ImpACOComplex#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ACOSurvey#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. One of the primary disadvantages of <#3845#>AS<#3845#> is that it tends to prematuve converge on local optima [#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#ImpACOComplex#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The premature convergence can be attributed to due to the ants exploiting the high concentration of pheromones on good solution paths too quickly[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. With the ants focusing only on the good solutions less exploration occurs in the search space leading to local optima being produced as the best solution[#FundamentalSwarm#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#].

<P>
Subsequently, various algorithms have been developed that improve on the <#3849#>AS<#3849#> algorithm. These improved algorithms include the <#3850#>ACS<#3850#>, <#3851#>MMAS<#3851#>, Ant-Q, fast ant system, AntTabu, <#3852#>AS<#3852#>-rank and i<#3853#>ANTS<#3853#>[#CompuIntelligenceIntro#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#,#AntIntroTrends#<tex2html_cite_mark>#1##<tex2html_cite_mark>#]. The discussion in this section is focused on providing an introduction to the general <#3855#>ACO<#3855#> algorithm concepts and not to discuss various improvements made by variants of the core algorithm. In the forth coming sections reference is made to these algorithms and their respective improvements.

<P>
The <#3856#>AS<#3856#> algorithm is the base algorithm upon which all other <#3857#>ACO<#3857#> class algorithms are based upon. Therefore in the forth coming sections when a reference is made to the <#3858#>ACO<#3858#> algorithm, it is directed at the base <#3859#>AS<#3859#> algorithm.

<P>
In this section the concepts  upon which the core of <#3860#>ACO<#3860#> is based upon were briefly introduced. In the next section a discussion is given on each of the concepts.
