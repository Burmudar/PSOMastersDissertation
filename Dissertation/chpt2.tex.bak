\chapter{The Frequency Assignment Problem}
\section{Introduction}
In the information age we currently live in almost every device has some sort of wireless technology it uses to provide a specific service. Radios for audio entertainment; Television remotes to change 
channels; Cellular phones for communication; Wireless access points to create wireless LAN's\cite{Karen2004}. Wireless technology is now part of our everyday life.

The popularity and rapid adoption of wireless technology hasn't been kind to the management, planning and operation of wireless networks; It has actually worsen a problem known as the Frequency Assignment problem (FAP) which is present in all forms of wireless communication especially in GSM Cellular networks.

In this chapter we will start of by giving a brief history of the Frequency Assignment Problem. After the brief history overview we will give a description of the problem and explain some of the
underlying concepts needed to understand the Frequency Assignment Problem. We will then move on to discuss the different variants present in the current domain. Futher more we will
then discuss the two underlying approaches used in solving the Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP).
\section{GSM Networks}
The General System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a system for multi-service cellular communication which is capable of providing voice as well as data services. Most cellular networks in operation 
are GSM based. The primary service that GSM caters for is radio bases communication, but other data services such as Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS) and internet 
connectivity services such as GPRS are becoming more important\cite{Eisenblatter}.

Since GSM network communication occurs through wireless radio certain radio bands need to be reserved for use by GSM networks. The two bands for which the GSM specification caters for is the 900 MHz and 1800 Mhz. Depending on which band a GSM network uses, the system is labelled as GSM 900 based or GSM 1800 based. In the GSM specification the GSM1800 is refered to as DCS1800 \cite{GSM92}.

GSM is one of the most widely used radio communications technologies, which is why we need to look at the history behind in order for us to understand the domain if radio communication better.We will now present a brief history of the GSM network 
specification.
\subsection{A Brief History of GSM Networks}
In the early 1980’s a group known as the Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) was established to develop a Europe wide radio communication system. The initial (also known as the first generation) system was 
analogue based. The second generation system was digital based and used time division multiple access on the radio interface. By the early 1990’s GSM became an evolving standard and the first GSM based 
network was demonstrated in 1991. The following year a number of GSM networks were operating in Europe this is mainly due to mobile cellphones capable of operating on the networks becoming more widely 
available to the general public. In the same year an operator in Australia became the first non-European operator to implement a GSM based network\cite{Eisenblatter}.

The collective subscriber base of GSM networks surpassed the million subscriber mark in 1993. Due to this phenomenal growth in GSM network use, numerous extensions were made to the GSM specification. 
Some of the extensions that were made are the following\cite{Eisenblatter}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Half rate speech telephony
\item Improved SMS
\item Line Identification
\item Call waiting
\item Call holding
\end{itemize}
The specification with these extensions defined is known as the GSM Phase 2. As the world shifted towards more digital and data intensive services it became difficult to deliver these services over GSM 
networks. This difficulty was due to the restriction that data could only be transmitted at 9.6 Kbps. A move to eliminate this restriction was made with the specification of GSM Phase 2+. 

The new specification defined new technologies such as General Packet Radio System (GPRS) and EDGE which were designed with the primary goal of making more bandwidth available for data transmission.
These new technologies have an inherent requirement that there be a higher signal to noise ratio present at transceivers. This requirement has an impact that effects radio interfaces and more 
importantly Frequency planning \cite{Eisenblatter}. 
The actual signal to noise ratio at a receiver is dependent on a number of factors that include \cite{Karen2004}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency used at the transceiver
\item Strength of the signal
\item Weather conditions
\item Shape of the surround environment
\item Direction of the transmission
\end{itemize}
Even taking these factors into account the calculation of the signal to noise ratio at a transceiver is not trivial. For a more in depth discussion on the calculation the reader is directed at the survey by \cite{Karen2004}.

The \emph{Universal Mobile Telecommunications System} (UMTS) can be considered the 3rd generation (3G) of the cellular networks. UMTS was designed from the beginning to operate in parallel with the 
legacy GSM system. This decision was made to make the deployment of the system as hassle free as possible for the network operators. The first standard of the UMTS was issued in the beginning of 2000 
and subsequently most modern networks are based on it.

UMTS is a large improvement of the GSM in two areas namely Data Transmission bandwidth and Frequency Planning due to UMTS utilizing \emph{DS-CDMA} (direct sequence code division multiple access) and \emph{WCDMA} (Wide Band Code Division Multiple Access). The higher data transmission speed (2 Mb/s) can be attributed to UMTS using the DS-CDMA scheme. The scheme also allows more users to be served than previous generation of networks. A direct consequence of WCDMA which sends information over a wideband of 5 MHz is that no frequency planning problem comparable to that of GSM has to be solved\cite{tabuglobalplanning3g,Eisenblatter}.

In this section we gave a brief overview of the history of the GSM Network specification. In the next section we will present an explanation of the topology of GSM network as well as look at the 
underlying problems present in a GSM networks.
\subsection{Topology of a GSM Network}
GSM networks consists of a variety of diffirent subsystems to realize the goal of establishing a radio communication link between two parties. The hierachy of systems and their respective connections to
each other is illustrated in figure 1. We will now briefly explain each subsystem.
\paragraph{Mobile Station}
A Mobile station (MS) as it is defined in the GSM spec refers to any mobile device that is capable of of making and receiving calls on a GSM network.  The MS is the main gateway 
for a user to gain access to the GSM network. The MS has two features which play an important role throughout the GSM Network, namely:
\begin{description}
\item[Subscriber Identififation Module (SIM)] --- Usually inserted into a mobile devices. The SIM contains the \emph{International Mobile Subscriber Identify} (IMSI) and is used throughout the network 
for Authentication as well as being a key part in providing encrypted transmissions.
\item[Equipment Identity Register(EIR)] --- Primaraly used in the denial of service by the network when “black” listed subcriber equipment tries to gain access to the network.
\end{description}
\paragraph{Base Station Subsystem} According to the GSM Phase 2+ specification this systen is viewed by the \emph{Message Station Controller} (MSC) through an Abis radio interface as the system responsible for communicating with Mobile Stations in a particular location area. The BSS usually consists of one \emph{Base Station Controller} (BSC) with one or more \emph{Base Transceiver Stations} (BTS). A BTS has similar equipment to that of a Mobile Station. Both have transceivers, antennas and the necessary functions to perform radio communication. The location where a BTS is installed is called a site. 

Typically a site is divided into 1 to 3 service sectors and each sector is allocated an antenna. Depending on how many sectors are at a site, the operating angle of the antennae needs to be adjusted 
accordingly to ensure 360 degree service. If there is only one sector an omni-directional antenna is used, otherwise the antennae operating angle are adjusted to $\frac{360\,^{\circ}}{n}$ where ${n}$ is the amount of antennae \cite{Eisenblatter}.

Within each sector there a cell is defined which operates one or more elementary transceivers called TRX’s. The amount of TRX’s per cell is determined by the expected peak traffic demand that the 
cell must be able to handle. Each TRX can handle 7 to 8 communication links or calls in parallel except the first TRX, which handles fewer calls than normal due to it being responsible for transmitting 
cell organization and protocol information \cite{Eisenblatter}. TRX’s are able to handle 7-8 calls in parallel due to the use of \emph{Frequency Division Multiplexing} (FDM) and \emph{Time Division 
Multiplexing} (TDM) schemes. TRX’s are assigned channels which enable them to provide conversion between digital traffic data on the network side and the radio communication between Mobile Stations and 
the GSM network. \cite{ACOvsEA,FAPOrientationModel}
\section{A Description of the Frequency Assignment Problem}
The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) is a generalization of the graph-coloring problem and is subsequently an NP-hard problem. This is because one has a finite amount of frequencies which needs to be 
assigned to antennae/transceivers (TRX's)  where the amount of transceivers to be assigned frequencies greatly out weigh the amount of available frequencies. Thus it is inevitable that a network will 
have interference and we can only minimise the amount of interference that might occur on the network - an optimization problem. 

A contributing factor to the difficulty of the FAP is due to the scarcity of useable frequencies in the radio spectrum, which forces network operators to reuse their allocated/licensed frequencies in their respective networks. The scarcity of the useable frequencies in the spectrum can be attributed to the overuse of certain bands as well as large scale reuse of frequencies in networks. This has put strain on the spectrum and has complicated the management of networks significantly because interference is more likely to occur.

Interference occurs when frequencies assigned to connections differ by a small margin. The amount of inference on a connection defines the quality of service. One can naturally make the deduction that 
the more frequencies differ used on connections in a area, the better quality of service one will experience in that area. Cellular networks use the amount of interference on their networks as 
qualitative measure for their \emph{Quality of Service} (QoS). A network with high interference would experience a lot of dropped connections, which occurs when the interference is too high to sustain a 
connection for communication.

Primarily Interference occurs if the Electromagnetic constraints are violated, which are defined as:
\begin{description}
\item[CoCell] ---
\item[Adj Channel] ---
\item[CoSite] ---
\end{description}
A fourth constraint, namely the Handover constraint is also applicable in Cellular networks which we will discuss in section 4.

Within the FAP domain there are  a variety of sub problems which originated over the decades of which wireless communication has survived through. We will discuss the most popular problems found in the 
literature over the last few years in Section 2. 
The FAP can be classified into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}[\bf{(}a\bf{)}]
\item \emph{Fixed Frequency/Channel Assignment} (FFA/FCA) is the process of permanently assigning frequencies to cells (cellular towers). The frequencies assigned are fixed and cannot be changed on the fly while 
the network is active , since the frequencies assigned to the cell form part of a delicate frequency plan designed to keep interference to minimum.
\item \emph{Dynamic Frequency/Channel Assignment} (DFA/DCA) is the process of allocating channels to cells as they require it to meet the current traffic demand imposed on them by clients. 
\end{enumerate}
Each cell can be assigned multiple frequencies based on the amount of transmitters or TRX's it has. The amount of TRX's in a cell depends on the expected amount of traffic the particular cell must 
handle.
Most of the research in the FAP has concentrated on the FFA. The reason for this is because FFA is a static technique, which allows it to come up with a better solution since it has more time for 
calculation. FFA is also easier to implement in practice and allows the network operators to cater for the worst case scenario - heavy traffic load on the network. The DFA is at the moment n a very hard 
problem because the network frequency plan is constantly changing, which means as the traffic on the network increases the longer the DFA focused algorithm will take to allocate a frequency. This 
increase in processing time is because the algorithm has to take into account more constraints with a lower available frequency pool. DFA must do this process within seconds since a cell needs to serve 
clients. Most researchers have concentrated on solving the FFA using heuristic approaches like neural networks, local search techniques and more recently meta heuristic approaches which include genetic 
algorithms, simulated annealing , ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization.\newline
In this section we have given a description of the Frequency Assignment Problem and introduced some concepts which we will use throughout the dissertation. In the next section we will present the 
Mathematics that govern the Frequency Assignment Problem.
