A new \gls{PSO} algorithm that produces solutions to the \gls{FS-FAP} is presented. Solutions to the \gls{FS-FAP} are used to allocate frequencies in a mobile telecommunications network and must have low interference. The standard \gls{PSO} algorithm's velocity method and global selection is ill suited for the \gls{FAP}.  Therefore using the standard \gls{PSO} algorithm as base, new techniques are developed to allow it to operate on the \gls{FAP}. The new techniques include two velocity methods and three global selection schemes. This study presents the results of the algorithm operating on the Siemens set of COST 259 problems and shows that it is viable applying the \gls{PSO} to the \gls{FAP}.
