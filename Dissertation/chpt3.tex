\chapter{The Frequency Assignment Problem}
\label{chpt:fap}
\section{Introduction}
The \glsreset{FAP}\gls{FAP} is a generalisation of the graph-colouring problem and is consequently an NP-Complete problem\cite{FAPRAMColouring}. The \gls{FAP} is an NP-Complete problem due to fact that only a finite number of frequencies can be assigned to \glspl{TRX}, where the number of transceivers to be assigned frequencies greatly outweighs the number of available frequencies\cite{FAPRAMColouring}. A more thorough definition of what it means for a problem to be NP-Complete is given in section~\ref{sec:NPComplete}.

In wireless communication a huge concern is interference, which occurs when, frequencies used for communication are close to each other in the frequency spectrum\cite{Karen2004}. Interference and its effects are discussed in detail in section~\ref{sec:Interference}. Essentially for the \gls{FAP} the primary concern is to develop an approximate plan on assigning frequencies in such a way that interference is kept to a minimum. 

Using exact algorithms to find a solution is not practical since the time to find a solution is polynomial. Generally metaheuristic algorithms are used to find optimal solutions to NP-Complete problems\cite{ACOvsEA}. Chapter~\ref{chpt:heuristic} presents a discussion on algorithms that are used to find solutions to NP-Complete problems. 

As discussed in chapter~\ref{chpt:celltech}, network operators are licensed a range of frequencies from the available spectrum. A licensed piece of spectrum contains a series of consecutive frequencies as well as gaps. Gap frequencies are barred from being used by any device within the network as they may have already been allocated to another operator for use \cite{FAPInCell}. By barring frequencies, a scenario is avoided where the different networks' equipment interferes with their respective operations\cite{FAPInCell}.

Due to the whole spectrum not being available to network operators and only a subset being available for commercial communication as per the frequencies allocated to them, networks opt to reuse their frequencies\cite{FAPInCell}. The networks do this to maximise the use of their allocated frequencies and to minimise their licensing fees, since if the network needs more frequencies, they need to be licensed\cite{FAPRAMColouring}.

It is not always possible to simply allocate more frequencies to a network even if the network pays the associated fees. The whole commercial spectrum may already have been licensed to various entities. Hence, licensed frequencies are a very valuable and scarce commodity \cite{FAPRAMColouring,FAPInCell}.

The chapter is organised as follows. The first section presents a discussion on NP-Complete problems. In section~\ref{sec:chm} constraint handling mechanisms are presented. Section~\ref{sec:FreqAssignmentTypes} presents an overview of different methods for allocated frequencies. Interference is discussed in depth in section~\ref{sec:Interference}. After the interference discussion a section is presented on the different types of frequencies assignment problems in section~\ref{sec:FAPVariants}. A mathematical formulation of the fixed spectrum frequency assignment problem is presented in section~\ref{sec:FAPMathDef}. Section~\ref{sec:FAPBenchmarks} provides an overview of the different benchmarks used to evaluate frequency assignment problems. After the discussion on the different benchmarks that are available in the domain a section on where the FAP is encountered in the industrial domain is presented. 

This chapter concludes with a section that summarises the contents presented. The next section presents an overview of what it means when a problem is NP-Complete.

\section{NP-Complete}
\label{sec:NPComplete}
The term NP stems from the field known as complexity analysis. Algorithms are measured for their worst running time using $O(n)$ notation when solving a particular problem.
An algorithm is said to be of polynomial time if the number of steps it needs to perform to solve the problem is given by $O(n^k)$ where $k$ is a nonnegative integer and $n$ refers to the complexity of the input\cite{AIModernApproach}.
Problems that can be \emph{solved} in polynomial time are referred to be in the P class of problems. Problems that form part of the NP class of problems differ to P problems in the sense that only their solutions can be \emph{verified} to be correct in polynomial time\cite{IntroToAlgos}. 
A problem in P is also in NP, this is due to the fact that the problem can be solved in polynomial time and therefore its solution can also be verified to be correct in polynomial time. Formally stated, the problem class P is a subset of NP or mathematically stated $P \subseteq NP$\cite{IntroToAlgos}.

A distinction needs to be made between when a problem is NP-Complete and when a problem is NP-Hard. A problem can be NP-Hard but not necessarily NP-Complete, consequently NP-Hard means that the problem is at the very least as difficult as the most difficult problems in NP. Thus a NP-Hard problem does not have to be a decision problem and therefore part of NP. The ``NP-hardness'' of the problem only gives an indication to its difficulty\cite{IntroToAlgos}.
A NP-Complete problem is a problem that is in NP and is also considered to be NP-Hard\cite{IntroToAlgos}. It is currently an open question in computer science, whether there exist algorithms which are able to solve NP-Complete algorithms. If there are such algorithms, it would mean that every NP problem has a corresponding algorithm which solves it\cite{IntroToAlgos}. In current research, there are no known algorithms that exist to solve NP-Complete problems in polynomial time but there is also no proof that exists that proves that no such algorithms exist\cite{IntroToAlgos}.

\section{Constraint handling mechanisms}
\label{sec:chm}
Not only is the \gls{FAP} an NP-Complete problem but it is also a constraint problem. Constraint problems restrict the search space of possible solutions with boundaries. These boundaries are referred to as constraints\cite{FundamentalSwarm}. The \gls{FAP} domain has specific constraints defined for each of the different individual problems. Before the various ways in which frequencies can be allocated is discussed a brief discussion needs to be presented on constraint handling mechanisms.

Constraints define the boundaries of the search space. Solutions found to be violating the constraints are considered to be outside of the search space. Solutions that are outside of the defined search space and thus violate the defined problem constraints can be handled using various methods\cite{FundamentalSwarm}. These methods are known to be \emph{constraint handling mechanisms} and are discussed below.
Engelbrecht\cite{FundamentalSwarm} defines the following mechanisms in his survey of current constriant handling mechanism research:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Reject infeasible solutions}} --- Solutions that violate the defined constraints are not even considered and rejected.
\item{\textbf{Penalty function methods}} --- Modifies the objective function to add a penalty that is enforced if a solution violates constraints. By adding a penalty the infeasible solutions are discouraged.
\item{\textbf{Convert the constrained problem to an unconstrained problem}} --- By converting any constraints defined by inequalities to boundary constraints the problem is converted to an unconstrained problem\cite{CompuIntelligenceIntro}. Solving unconstrained problems can lead to better solutions being found, although not guaranteed.
\item{\textbf{Preserving feasibility methods}} --- Candidate solutions are initialised in the search space and satisfy all constraints. These solutions are continuously moved or transformed with specialised operators which ensure that the solutions continue to satisfy all the constraints. The operators ensure that all solutions stay within the bounded search space.
\item{\textbf{Pareto ranking methods}} --- Solutions are ranked based on the severity of their constraint violations. Ranking is achieved by using concepts from multi-objective optimisation. For more information the reader is directed to literature by Engelbrecht\cite{FundamentalSwarm}.
\item{\textbf{Repair methods}} --- Operators are used to transform solutions that violate constraints to solutions that adhere to all the constraints and are thus feasible solutions.
\end{itemize}

Constraint handling methods need to be used when solving constrained problems like the \gls{FAP}. Without these methods, the search for solutions is undirected and solutions that cannot be used are presented as most optimal. Reference to these methods are made where applicable.
The following section discusses two methods that define how frequencies are allocated.
\section[Frequency Allocation Types]{Different methods used to allocate frequencies}
\label{sec:FreqAssignmentTypes}
In this section the different methods used to allocate frequencies to cells in a cellular network are discussed. Furthermore the method that relates to the specific \gls{FAP} variant in this dissertation is described.

Within the \gls{FAP} domain there are different types of \gls{FAP}, which have emerged over the years as the domain of wireless communications matured and technological requirements changed. These \gls{FAP} variants are discussed in section~\ref{sec:FAPVariants}.
There are a variety of \gls{FAP}s in the wireless communication domain but each individual problem can be classified into one of the following two categories based on the way frequencies are assigned to cells:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{\Gls{FFA}} is where frequencies assigned to cells are static; therefore they cannot be changed until a new assignment plan is calculated\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.
\item \emph{\Gls{DFA}} is the process of allocating frequencies to cells as required to meet the current traffic demand imposed on them by clients\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fixed Frequency/Channel Assignment}
\gls{FFA} is the process of permanently assigning frequencies to cells \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. The frequencies assigned are fixed and cannot be changed immediately while the network is active, since the frequencies assigned to the cell form part of a delicate frequency plan designed to keep interference on communication links to a minimum\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. 

When the channel used by a particular cell for communication is suddenly changed, the cell might start interfering with neighbouring cells' communication links. This interference is caused because the assigned frequencies of the neighbouring cells are close to each other on the frequency spectrum. Hence, if the cell is sectored (refer to section~\ref{def:cellsector} in chapter two for a discussion on cell sectorisation) it can interfere with a minimum of three and up to a maximum of six neighbouring cells\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.

When an \gls{FFA} plan is created, cells are assigned frequencies based on the estimated traffic that a cell will be expected to handle during peak network usage. \gls{FFA} is ideally suited for macro cellular networks since the nature of the traffic encountered in such networks has the characteristic of being homogeneous, stationary and predictable \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. Macro cellular networks are networks where the size of a single cell typically spans 5 - 30 km\cite{WirelessCommunications}.

With \gls{FFA}, networks are able to permanently allocate a certain subset of frequencies to cells since the nature of the traffic on their network allows them to predict with reasonable certainty the call blocking probability \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. A call is blocked on the network when a cell has no available frequencies to use when establishing a communication link \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.
In situations where the nature of the traffic is neither homogeneous nor stationary, using the \gls{FFA} allocation scheme is not feasible as its use of available frequencies is grossly inefficient \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.

A problem that occurs with \gls{FFA} when all assigned frequencies are in use is that any new call or call handed over will be blocked\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. The call will be blocked even if adjacent cells have suitable capacity to handle the call\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.

\subsection{Dynamic Frequency/Channel Assignment}
\gls{DFA} is a channel allocation scheme where frequencies assigned to cells are not permanent but rather assigned to cells as the need arises\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. Therefore all the frequencies licensed by a particular network are available to each and every cell to establish a communication link as long as the channel does not violate the co-channel reuse constraint \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. Briefly, the co-channel reuse constraints dictates that frequencies allocated on the same transceiver must differ by a certain margin. A more thorough definition is given in section~\ref{sec:Interference}.

The co-channel reuse constraint must be adhered to otherwise the amount of interference occurring on the communication link will be too much\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication}.

The \gls{DFA} allocation scheme is ideally suited for micro cellular wireless networks. Micro cellular networks are networks where the size of a single cell typically spans less that 1km. The traffic on these networks have the characteristic of being immensely unpredictable as traffic demand varies constantly\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication,MobileWirelessCommunications}.

As the name indicates, micro cellular wireless networks have much smaller cell sizes than macro cellular networks. The size of cells matter when one considers handover requests. A handover request occurs when a cell handling a connection of an MS needs to transfer control of the connection to another cell due to the MS moving out of the geographical area the cell is responsible for. For more information on the handover process the reader is directed to section~\ref{sec:handover}. Due to the size a cell in a micro cellular network must handle a lot more handover requests than a cell in a macro cellular network, since an \gls{MS} with an active connection is much more likely to move out of the coverage area of a micro cell than a macro cell \cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications}.
Since a micro cellular network has increased handover requests between cells compared with a macro cellular network, a \gls{DFA} scheme must rapidly allocate frequencies to requesting cells that must handle the handovers\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications}.

\gls{DFA} is much more efficient than \gls{FFA} when the amount of mobile traffic on the network is relatively low\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications}. On the other hand, when the network is under heavy mobile traffic load, the \gls{FFA} scheme outperforms the \gls{DFA} scheme\cite{WirelessCommunications}. The \gls{DFA} scheme is outperformed because it allocates frequencies to cells in an inefficient arrangement that might affect the amount of interference encountered on the network\cite{MobileWirelessCommunications}.

Finally \gls{DFA} inherently requires a great deal more computational power than \gls{FFA}, since the frequencies need to be selected and allocated with great speed, otherwise the cell requesting a channel will not be able to handle the call and will therefore block the call or drop the call\cite{PrinciplesMobileCommunication,WirelessCommunications}.


This concludes the discussion on the different allocation schemes used in modern cellular networks. The next section gives a description of what interference is and why it is important for cellular networks. An overview will also be given of when interference occurs.

\section{Interference}
\label{sec:Interference}
Interference can be defined as any unwanted signal that is received along with a signal of interest\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}. The unwanted signal is said to \emph{interfere} with the original signal and as a consequence degrades the original signal quality with unwanted information\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}.

Interference usually occurs when two or more entities communicate independently on the same channel or on adjacent frequencies\cite{WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications}. Other external factors can also contribute to interference on a communication link, such as machines, which inherently produce some sort of electromagnetic distortion, for instance a car's ignition or a big turbine\cite{WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications}. 
Interference that occurs when two signals operate on the same channel can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:sameinterference} and interference that occurs as a consequence of two signals operating on adjacent frequencies can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:adjacentinterference}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
	\input{tikz-pics/cochannel.tex}
	\caption{Co-channel interference}
	\label{fig:sameinterference}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
	\input{tikz-pics/adjchannel.tex}
	\caption{Adjacent channel interference}
	\label{fig:adjacentinterference}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

The magnitude of the interference experienced on a communicational link is at its maximum when the devices involved in the link are geographically close to each other. As the geographical distance between these devices increases, the magnitude of interference experienced decreases. Therefore, to minimise the impact interference will have on communication links a \emph{separation} is defined\cite{WirelessCommunications}. More specifically, this separation is known as the channel reuse or frequency reuse distance within wireless networks\cite{WirelessCommunications}.

This separation is defined as the minimum number of cells (which must all use different frequencies) that are allowed to be between two cells before either one of the cells are allowed to use the same frequency\cite{WirelessCommunications,InterferenceOrientatedFAP}. 
The separation can be depicted visually as in figure~\ref{fig:seperationgraph} where $f_a,f_b,f_c,f_d$ are different frequencies that are assigned to the specific cells. The frequency $f_a$ is allowed to be reused since the two cells it is assigned to are separated by three cells (shaded in grey) because the separation for this network was set to three.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{centering}
	\input{tikz-pics/SeparationGraph.tex}
	\caption{Frequency Separation}
	\label{fig:seperationgraph}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}


As discussed earlier, cellular networks are forced to reuse their licensed frequencies multiple times to keep costs to a minimum. Therefore, the design of a cellular network is limited to the defined separation distance between cells as it defines the size of cells that will be in the network\cite{Eisenblatter,InterferenceOrientatedFAP}. Smaller cells can lead to a larger separation distance compared with when cells are larger\cite{WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications}.

Cellular networks use the amount of interference on their networks as a qualitative measure for their \gls{QoS}\cite{WirelessCommunications}. A network with high interference would experience a lot of dropped connections/calls, which occurs when the interference is too high to sustain a connection or call for communication; consequently their \gls{QoS} degrades as interference increases\cite{WirelessCommunications,WirelessDigitalCommunications}.

Even though interference can cause a call or connection to be lost, i.e.\ dropped, there are other situations where a call can be dropped\cite{GSMSysEngin}. A situation where a call can be dropped is when a handover procedure occurs between two cells and one cell receiving the call is at full utilisation of its allocated frequencies\cite{GSMSysEngin,WirelessDigitalCommunications}. Another situation can be due to weather conditions. Weather brings forth natural interference or the caller entering a building, which drastically reduces cellular reception\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}.

In the literature a variety of methods are used to calculate the amount of interference in a network. The \gls{SIR} ratio is the recommended way of calculating the potential interference at a certain point \cite{Karen2004}. 

The \gls{SIR} equation is actually based on the \gls{SINR} but since cellular networks are interference limited, the noise (denoted as $N_0$) is not considered in the final interference calculation\cite{WirelessCommunications}. Noise can be disregarded since the power of interference is much larger than the power of noise, which is why in the following formulation of \gls{SINR} and \gls{SIR}, the \gls{SIR} formulation omits $N_0$ as part of the calculation\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}.
A formulation of the \gls{SINR} and \gls{SIR} is as follows:

\begin{align}
	SINR &= \frac{P_r}{N_0 + P_I}\\
	SIR &= \frac{P_r}{P_I}
\end{align}
Where $P_r$ is the power of the received signal and $P_I$ is the power associated with interference from within a cell (intracell interference) and interference from outside a cell (intercell interference)\cite{WirelessCommunications}.
This calculation can be considered a best guess as it models the environment, weather and other factors which may influence the potential interference at a point with a Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation for noise represented by the $N_0$\cite{Karen2004}.

Using the \gls{SIR} formula cellular networks are able to determine the \gls{BER} users on the network will experience on their connections\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}. The \gls{BER} is defined as the probability that a received bit on the connection will be incorrect\cite{MobileWirelessCommunications}. 

As the \gls{BER} increases voice quality on the connection decreases since more bits that are used to describe the voice information are incorrectly received\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}. \gls{SIR} and \gls{BER} probability are interlinked. As \gls{SIR} increases, i.e. less interference is encountered on the communication link; the probability that bits will be received incorrectly decreases\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}.
Whether precise measurements are taken or the interference is calculated based on the \gls{SIR} formula, the end result of both methods is that all the calculated or measured values are put into a matrix to produce an \emph{interference matrix}\cite{ACOvsEA}.

An interference matrix consists of a number of cell pairs (\emph{i,j}), where \emph{i} is the cell receiving interference and \emph{j} the cell whose allocated channel is providing the interference\cite{Karen2004}. Each cell pair in the matrix has two corresponding values that indicate the level of interference if the \emph{electromagnetic constraints} are violated \cite{ACOvsEA,AndreasPaper}. 
Primarily interference occurs when the electromagnetic constraints are violated. These constraints are defined as:
\begin{description}
\item[Co-channel] --- As discussed earlier, when cell \emph{i} and cell \emph{j} operate on the same channel interference will occur \cite{GSMSysEngin,PrinciplesMobileCommunication}. When this type of interference occurs it is referred to as \emph{co-channel} interference.
\item[Adjacent channel] --- When cell \emph{i} and cell \emph{j} operate on adjacent frequencies, their allocated frequencies differ by one, i.e.\ cell \emph{i} operates on channel \emph{f}, then if cell \emph{j} operates on either channel \emph{f - 1} or \emph{f + 1}, then interference will occur\cite{GSMSysEngin,InterferenceOrientatedFAP}. This type of interference is referred to as \emph{adjacent channel} interference.
\end{description}

The electromagnetic constraints defined above are applicable in any wireless network. With regard to mobile telecommunication networks, such as cellular networks, there are additional constraints that are imposed due to technological requirements, availability, location and size of area with unacceptable interference \cite{Karen2004,Eisenblatter,AndreasPaper}. These constraints are defined as the following:
\begin{description}
\item[Co-site] --- If cell \emph{i} and cell \emph{j} are located at the same site, then their allocated channel ranges must differ by a certain distance in the frequency domain. This distance is known as the reuse distance where cell \emph{i} and cell \emph{j} serve different sectors\cite{FixedFAPPSO,EgyptFAPPSO}. In the benchmarks, which are discussed in section~\ref{sec:FAPBenchmarks} this distance is also referred to as the \emph{separation variable}. 
\item[Co-cell] --- Channels used on the same antennae of a cell must differ by a certain number. This is typically set to three but can be any number greater than zero that the network operator deems necessary to avoid unwanted interference\cite{Karen2004,Eisenblatter,AndreasPaper}.
\item[Handover] --- This constraint means that frequencies must differ by a predefined margin, i.e. two or three, when one cell hands over a call to another cell. If this constraint is violated a mobile subscriber will experience a dropped call since the handover between cells fails\cite{Karen2004,Eisenblatter,AndreasPaper}.
\end{description}

Within the licences of wireless networks there are two hard constraints, which forbid networks from using certain frequencies. Hard constraints means that under no circumstances are these constraints allowed to be violated.

The first set of hard constraint frequencies is known as \emph{globally blocked frequencies}. Frequencies that are in the set of globally blocked frequencies are usually frequencies that have been licensed to other networks\cite{Karen2004,InterferenceOrientatedFAP}.

The second set of hard constraint frequencies is known as \emph{locally blocked frequencies}. These frequencies are not allowed at certain geographic areas but are free for use at any other area\cite{InterferenceOrientatedFAP}. A typical area where certain frequencies will be forbidden to be used is near a country border\cite{InterferenceOrientatedFAP}. The locally blocked frequencies are most likely in use by another network resident to the bordered country.

In this section a description was given of what interference is and what the consequences are of too much interference in a network. This section further elaborated on the circumstances in which interference can occur in a wireless network. The next section presents an overview of the various different sub problems in the \gls{FAP} domain.


\section{Frequency Assignment Problem types}
\label{sec:FAPVariants}
In this section each of the problem variants for the \gls{FAP} is discussed, starting with one of the first and oldest problems in the \gls{FAP} domain. This section will conclude with a discussion on the particular variant of \gls{FAP} focussed on in this research.
\subsection{Minimum Order Frequency Assignment Problem}
The \gls{MO-FAP} was the first \gls{FAP} that emerged in the 1970s. The \gls{MO-FAP} is concerned with assigning frequencies to transmitters while interference is minimised as well as minimising the number of different frequencies used\cite{Karen2004}. 

In \gls{MO-FAP} channel reuse is prioritised and the usage of a channel has a certain cost associated with it. The reason for this is that when the wireless network industry started, operators were billed according to the number of different frequencies they used. In the beginning of commercial cellular networks frequencies were not cheap since they were sold per unit \cite{MontemanniThesis}. 

Over the years as the law governing the wireless spectrum changed and new technology as well as standards emerged, \gls{MO-FAP} lost its relevancy\cite{Karen2004,MontemanniThesis}. Companies are no longer billed according to the different frequencies they use, but they purchase licences from a regulatory body\cite{Karen2004,MontemanniThesis}. This licence usually stipulates what channel band the network is allowed to use.

In some instances a piece of open frequency spectrum is put up for auction by a regulatory body, on which interested parties can bid to own the specified spectrum\cite{Karen2004,MontemanniThesis}. Open frequency spectrum is a series of frequencies which might be continuous or disjointed that is not owned nor used by any particular body. Due to the shift in how frequencies are allocated to networks, neither the regulatory bodies nor the network operators care about the number of different frequencies used\cite{Karen2004,MontemanniThesis}.
\subsection{Minimum Span Frequency Assignment Problem}
The \gls{MS-FAP} is a problem that is very relevant today, especially when network operators want to deploy a new network in a region\cite{Karen2004}. The \gls{MS-FAP} is concerned with keeping the interference below a certain level during assignment as well as minimising the span\cite{MSFAP}. The interference threshold used is specified by the network designer as the minimum allowable interference on the network\cite{MSFAP}.

The span is defined as an interval on the frequency domain. This interval is the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies used during assignment\cite{Karen2004,MSFAP}. With the span value, network operators are able to request certain frequency bands and know their network will be able to operate at suitable interference levels \cite{Karen2004,MSFAP}.

The \gls{MS-FAP} and \gls{MO-FAP} are two very similar problems, the only difference being that \gls{MO-FAP} focuses on minimising different frequencies and \gls{MS-FAP} focuses on minimising the interval of frequencies used during assignment \cite{Karen2004}.
\subsection{Minimum Interference Frequency Assignment Problem}
The \gls{MI-FAP} or \gls{FS-FAP} is encountered after the network operator has obtained a frequency band from a regulatory body\cite{Karen2004}.
Unlike the previous problems, in \gls{MI-FAP} any available channel in the allocated band may be used even though it produces interference. The other problems are concerned with the frequencies used, even though they might be violating some constraints that incur a huge amount of interference\cite{MontemanniThesis,MultipleBinaryFAP}. The interference value does not play a large role in their respective objective functions\cite{Eisenblatter,MultipleBinaryFAP}. In \gls{MI-FAP} the objective is to minimise the total amount of interference on the network. It is important to note that this amount of interference might not necessarily be zero \cite{Karen2004,Eisenblatter}.

The \gls{MI-FAP} is the problem currently most encountered in cellular networks, since there are more operating networks than new networks being designed in the cellular industry today\cite{Karen2004}. This particular problem forms the focus of this research. 

Since \gls{MI-FAP} is very close to real-world instance problems, authors tend to use real-world instances or benchmarks to test the quality and efficiency of their algorithms \cite{Eisenblatter,MontemanniThesis}. The quality and efficiency of the solution in this research is benchmarked against the \gls{COST} 259 benchmark, which is discussed in section~\ref{sec:FAPBenchmarks}.

The following section outlines a formal mathematical definition for the fixed spectrum \gls{MI-FAP}. The definition is important as it forms the basis for the objective/cost function that the algorithm in this research uses.
 
\section{FS-FAP Mathematical Formulation}
\label{sec:FAPMathDef}
A mathematical definition of the \gls{FAP} is given in this section. The mathematical definition is used by the algorithm discussed in this dissertation to evaluate the amount of interference that generated frequency plans exhibit.

The \gls{FAP} can be represented as a graph colouring problem and is known to be NP-Complete. Before a mathematical definition can be formally given for the \gls{FAP}, some symbols and their respective definitions need to be introduced.

\begin{align}
	G &= (V,E) \label{E:setG}\\
	V &= \{v_{0},v_{1},\ldots,v_{i}\} | i \in \mathbb{N} \label{E:setV}\\
	E &= \{\{v_0,v_1\},\{v_0,v_2\},\ldots,\{v_i,v_j\}\}|v \in V,\forall ij \in \mathbb{N},i \neq j \label{E:setE}\\
	D &= \{d_{01},d_{02},\ldots,d_{ij}\}| \forall\{i,j\} \in E, \exists d_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}^+ \label{E:setD}\\
    P &= \{\{\bar{p_{00}},\overset{=}{p_{01}}\},\{\bar{p_{10}},\overset{=}{p_{11}}\},\ldots,{\bar{p_{i0}},\overset{=}{p_{i1}}\}\}| \forall \{i,j\} \in E,\exists p_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}^+ \label{E:setP}\\
	F &= \{0,1,2,3,\ldots,k\}| \forall k \in \mathbb{N},\forall v \in V \exists f \in F\label{E:setF}\\
	d_{ij} &< |f(i) - f(j)|, \forall ij \in \mathbb{N},i \neq j \label{E:interference}
\end{align}

Let $G$ (see equation~\ref{E:setG}) be a weighted undirected graph, where $V$ (see equation~\ref{E:setV}) is a set of vertices\cite{MontemanniThesis}. Each $v \in V(G)$ represents a transceiver in the \gls{FAP}\cite{MontemanniThesis}. 

The variable $E$ in equation~\ref{E:setE} represents a set of edges\cite{MontemanniThesis}. An edge consists of two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ that are joined because there is a constraint on the frequencies that can be assigned between the two vertices or transmitters\cite{MontemanniThesis}. The constraints which govern the edge is represented two associated labels $d_{ij}$ and $p_{ij}$ that are defined on each edge\cite{FAPOrientationModel,TabuMontemanniSmith}. 

The label $d_{ij}$ that is part of the set $D$ (see equation~\ref{E:setD}) denotes the maximum separation that is required between frequencies assigned to two transmitters $v_i$ and $v_j$. $f(i)$ denotes the frequency assigned to $i$. Using equation~\ref{E:interference} the amount of interference that is generated between transmitters $v_i$ and $v_j$ can be determined\cite{FAPOrientationModel,TabuMontemanniSmith}.

The other label, $p_{ij}$, forms part of the set $P$ (see equation~\ref{E:setP}), which is referred to as the interference matrix (discussed in section~\ref{sec:Interference})\cite{Eisenblatter}. Each label $p_{ij}$ contains two values, which represent interference:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bar{p_{i0}}$ represents the value for co-channel interference \cite{FAPOrientationModel,TabuMontemanniSmith}. 
\item $\overset{=}{p_{i1}}$ represents the value for adjacent channel interference\cite{FAPOrientationModel,TabuMontemanniSmith}.
\end{itemize}

Finally the set $F$ (see equation~\ref{E:setF}) denotes a set of consecutive frequencies for every transmitter in $V$\cite{FAPOrientationModel,TabuMontemanniSmith}.
Formally the \gls{FS-FAP} can now be defined \gls{FS-FAP} $= (V,E,D,P,F)$ with a required mapping of $f: V \rightarrow F$\cite{TabuMontemanniSmith}. \Gls{FS-FAP} is a permutation problem where an assignment of frequencies to transmitters needs to be found in order to minimise the sum of total interference (see equation~\ref{E:costFunction}).

The interference value for a single transmitter is represented by $c(p_i)$ which is based on equation~\ref{E:interferenceCases}. In equation~\ref{E:interferenceCases} the co-channel interference value is represented by $\bar{p_{i0}}$ and the adjacent-channel interference value is represented by $\overset{=}{p_{i1}}$.

\begin{align} 
 \label{E:interferenceCases}
 c(p_i) &= 
 \begin{cases}
	\bar{p_{i0}} &,\text{if $|f(i) - f(j)| = 0$}\\
	\overset{=}{p_{i1}} &, \text{if $|f(i) - f(j)| \leqslant d_{ij}$}\\
	0 &,\text{if $|f(i) - f(j)| > d_{ij}$}
 \end{cases}\\
 \label{E:costFunction}
 Total Interference &= \sum^{|P|}_{i = 0}c(p_i),p_i \in P 
\end{align}

The following section provides a brief discussion on the different \gls{FAP} benchmarks that exist. The section also defines benchmark against which the algorithm developed in this research is evaluated.
\section{FAP Benchmarks}
\label{sec:FAPBenchmarks}
Some of the most used benchmarks in the \gls{FAP} domain are now discussed. The first benchmark was introduced in the 1970s.
\subsection{Philadelphia Benchmarks}
The Philadelphia benchmarks are derived from an instance that was introduced in 1973 by Anderson\cite{AndersonPhiladelphia}. Each instance is a hexagonal grid of cells that overlaps the area of interest. At the centre of each cell there is a transmitter. Past approaches used these hexagonal systems to model modern cellular networks \cite{Karen2004,ExactMIFAP}.

In this benchmark interference is measured by a co-channel reuse distance\cite{Karen2004}. This distance stipulates that the difference between the frequencies  assigned to two cells must be greater than or equal to a certain value $d$. A channel cannot be assigned to a cell if it violates this minimum distance \cite{ExactMIFAP}.
These benchmarks are typically used to test algorithms developed for \gls{MS-FAP}, since there is no concept of cost or penalty for interference incurred by violating constraints.
\subsection{CELAR}
In 1994 \gls{EUCLID} introduced a project called CALMA, which was a combined effort by several European governments that were part of \gls{EUCLID} to investigate algorithms for military applications\cite{Karen2004}. The project was granted to six research groups. Within the project 36 instances were made available by the \emph{Centre d'ELectronique de l'ARmement} (CELAR) for radio link frequency assignment \cite{Karen2004,DynamicFAP}.

All the CELAR instances have the constraint that the difference between frequencies assigned to interfering radio links must be greater than a certain predefined distance in the frequency domain\cite{Karen2004}. This is a soft constraint and may be violated. Another constraint in the CELAR instances is that each pair of parallel links must differ by an exact predefined distance\cite{Karen2004}. This constraint is a hard constraint and may not be violated \cite{DynamicFAP}.

These instances were initially not available to the general public as they were contained to be within the CALMA project\cite{CALMA}. In 2001 the CELAR launched the International ROADEF challenge, where certain instances from the CALMA project were made available for the research teams taking part in the challenge\cite{CALMA}. The instances made available had been modified to take polarisations and controlled relaxations of certain EMC constraints \cite{LowerPolarFAP}.
\subsection{COST 259}
\label{sec:COST259}
\glsreset{COST}
The \gls{COST} 259 is a set of real-world \gls{gsm} instances made available by the European Union. The instances are publicly available and can  be downloaded for free at http://fap.zib.de/ (FAP Web 2011). The website also contains the most recent results obtained by researchers using these instances\cite{Karen2004,Eisenblatter}. The site contains 5 different sets of problems namely Tiny, Bradford, Swisscom, K and Siemens. Out of the 5 sets Siemens has garnered the most attention which is due to the instances resembling real world instances. Consequently this is also why the Siemens instances were chosen for the research presented in this dissertation.

The instances are difficult due to the large number of transmitters (900 - 4 000) that need to be assigned frequencies, with a small number of spectrum of frequencies. The most important characteristic of these benchmarks are that they resemble real-world \gls{gsm} network data. Due to these benchmarks' difficulty along with their real-world applicability, they were selected as the main benchmarks to evaluate the algorithm presented in this dissertation.

More specifically this research concentrates on a small subset of the instances that are available, namely Siemens 1, Siemens 2, Siemens 3 and Siemens 4. In the paper by Montemanni and Smith \cite{TabuMontemanniSmith} the same subset of problems was used and to date their algorithm has produced some of the best results. 

As discussed in section~\ref{sec:chm} constraint handling mechanisms need to be used for problems like the \gls{FAP}. Each of the Siemens benchmarks define a set of globally or locally blocked frequencies, which are hard constraints. Due to this constraint one of the mechanisms that will be used in the algorithm to handle solutions violating this constraint is \emph{to reject any solutions that is found to violate this hard constraint}. The characteristics of each instance will now be discussed.

\subsubsection{Siemens 1}
The Siemens 1 instance resembles a \gls{gsm} network that follows the \gls{gsm}900 standard. This particular network has been allocated a spectrum set of frequencies $F = \{16,17,18,\dots,90\}$ which are allowed to be assigned to cells. 

Not all 74 frequencies are available to be used by the network. The allocated frequency block is split into two blocks. According to the problem instance frequencies ranging from $F= \{36,37,38,\dots,67\}$ are globally blocked. Only frequencies ranging from $F= \{16,17,\dots,35\}$ and $F= \{68,69,70,\dots,90\}$ therefore available for assignment.

This problem instance finally also defines this network as consisting of a total of 506 cells where on average each cell has 1.84 transceivers that need to be assigned a frequency. The co-site separation is stated to be two and the co-cell separation is stated to be three.

In this problem a total of 931 transceivers needs to be assigned a frequency out of the 74 available frequencies. The  higher the number of transceivers and the lower the number of available frequencies, the more difficult the problem is.
\subsubsection{Siemens 2}
The Siemens 2 problem instance describes a \gls{gsm} network based on \gls{gsm}900 and has 86 sites. The problem specifies that the network consists of 254 cells where each cell has on average 3.85 transceivers that need to be assigned frequencies.

For this problem, the network has been allocated two blocks of frequencies: one block of four frequencies ranging from $F = \{42,43,44,45,46\}$ and a second block of frequencies ranging from $F= \{53,54,55,\dots,124\}$. The frequencies allocated to the network have been split into two blocks because frequencies ranging from $F = \{47,48,49,50,51,52\}$ are globally blocked. Finally the problem specifies that the co-site separation must be set to two and the co-cell separation must be set to three.

This problem is more difficult than Siemens 1, as there are 977 transceivers that need to be assigned frequencies out of a pool of 75 frequencies. Contributing to the difficulty of Siemens 2 is due to the problem defining that there are 40 more transceivers for assignment and almost the same amount of frequencies to be used assignment as Siemens 1.
\subsubsection{Siemens 3}
The Siemens 3 problem describes a network based on \gls{gsm}900. This network has been allocated a continuous set of frequencies $F= \{681,682, \dots, 735\}$. Thus the network has 55 frequencies, which can be allocated to transceivers in its network.

The problem defines the network as consisting of 366 sites and 894 cells. On average each cell has 1.82 transceivers that need to be allocated a frequency to handle communication.

With Siemens 3 the FAP becomes a lot more difficult as there are  1627 transceivers which needs to be assign frequencies out of a pool of 55. The more transceivers that are defined which need assignment, the more frequencies have to be reused.
\subsubsection{Siemens 4}
The Siemens 4 instance is similar to a \gls{gsm} network that follows the \gls{gsm}900 standard. According to this instance this network has been allocated 39 continuous frequencies starting at 56, thus $F = \{56,57,58,\dots,94\}$. No frequencies are said to be globally or locally blocked in this network.

According to this problem instance this network has 276 sites and consists of 760 cells. Where each cell is said to have on average 3.66 transceivers. The Co-site separation is set to be two and the co-cell separation must be three. Out of the 4 benchmarks problems, Siemens 4 is the most difficult as it defines that the total number of transceivers that require assignment as 2781 with only 39 frequencies.

The next section presents a general overview on the different industries where the \gls{FAP} is encountered. The purpose of this discussion is to get a better understanding about how far reaching the problem is and the different forms the problem is encountered in.

\section{FAP in the Industry}
\label{sec:FAPIndustry}
FAP is a real-world problem that is encountered in industries that make use of wireless technology for wireless communication\cite{Karen2004}. For each industry listed, a brief overview is given of how the problem differs compared with other industries. 

\subsection{Wireless Mesh Networks and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)}
Wireless mesh networks and WLANs are the most recent applications where the \gls{FAP} is encountered. 
Multiple WLANs are increasingly being used to provide backbone support for large fixed line networks, enterprise networks, campuses and metropolitan areas\cite{MultiradioMeshNetworks}. To be able to provide backbone support for these networks, a primary design goal when designing and deploying these networks is capacity\cite{MultiradioMeshNetworks}. A limiting factor for WLAN capacity is interference, which affects multihop hop settings. Thus the overall network interference needs to be minimized to increase the capacity of the network \cite{MultiradioMeshNetworks}. Multihop refers to the fact that messages are sent following different paths towards the recipient, the message is said to ``hop'' from one BTS to another until its recipient is reached or until a maximum number of hops. Due to messages that can get lost due to interference, multihop helps to establish some reliability\cite{WirelessDigitalCommunications}.

Typical approaches allocating frequencies include using \gls{DFA} and \gls{FFA} (discussed in section~\ref{sec:FreqAssignmentTypes}). \gls{DFA} is not very popular because the dynamic switching of frequencies lowers the response time on commodity hardware since there is a delay in milliseconds when switching frequencies. Typical packet transmission times are in microseconds. To guarantee uptime and high responsiveness, \gls{FFA} is the preferred approach \cite{MultiradioMeshNetworks}.

The \gls{FAP} in wireless mesh networks and WLANs differs from the standard problem in that it introduces an extra constraint. Channels assigned to links on a node cannot be more than the available interfaces on that particular node. This constraint is known as the \emph{interface constraint} \cite{MultiradioMeshNetworks}. Another aspect to consider is the placement of access points (APs) in the network, which is similar to the problem cellular networks face with regard to base station placement \cite{Karen2004}.

\subsection{Military Field Communication}
In a military context the \gls{FAP} is a very difficult problem to be solved due to its dynamic nature\cite{CALMA}. During deployment, connections need to be established rapidly between nodes, which guarantee that the nodes will stay static at locations. Usually nodes are military field phones or can be any transceiver device \cite{CALMA,DynamicFAP}. 

Due to the nature of the problem the \gls{DFA} scheme is used to allocate frequencies to nodes. The military \gls{FAP} has the property that any of the nodes are mobile and can move at any moment to a new location, potentially interfering with another connection\cite{CALMA,DynamicFAP}. This property differs from the traditional \gls{FAP} where the nodes that are allocated frequencies are stationary\cite{CALMA}. Two frequencies need to be assigned to each connection that is established, one for each direction of communication. These allocated frequencies must also differ by a certain distance in the frequency domain to prohibit alternating directions of communication from interfering\cite{CALMA,DynamicFAP}.

A lot of literature can be found on Military field communication. This is due to two organisations CELAR and \gls{EUCLID} making data available to various research groups and allowing them to develop algorithms for frequency assignment \cite{CALMA,DynamicFAP}. 

\subsection{Television and Radio Broadcasting}
The \gls{FAP} encountered in broadcasting very closely resembles the problem domain found in cellular networks\cite{Karen2004}. The only notable difference is that the required distance by which allocated frequencies must differ in the frequency domain are larger in broadcasting than in cellular networks \cite{Karen2004}.

Since the problem resembles the problem found in cellular networks, there are few articles that specifically discuss frequency assignment in broadcasting as a main topic. Research that specifically examines \gls{FAP} in broadcasting has been conducted by Idoumghar and Schott \cite{RadioFAP}.
\subsection{Cellular Communication}
Cellular communication (see chapter 2 for a discussion) can be considered the main driving force behind research in the frequency assignment domain. As new standards are developed and used in 3G networks, in general a \gls{FAP} still needs to be solved since these newer technologies still use \gls{gsm} as their backbone architecture, as discussed in section~\ref{UMTSGSMBackbone}. With new networks being deployed or current networks being expanded, standard \gls{gsm} is used as it is cheaper than using the latest 3G technology. Therefore, standard \gls{gsm} is still relevant and in use in modern networks.

There is a wealth of research that concentrates on the \gls{FAP} within cellular networks. This is because cellular networks are used by millions of people around the world and as such this presents an interesting notion to produce better results since viable solutions have the possibility to impact millions of people. Most of the literature concentrates on this domain and one can find a lot of research in the literature presenting viable algorithms that produce real-world solutions \cite{Eisenblatter}. 

Because the \gls{FAP} problem is NP-Complete most presented algorithms are either of the metaheuristic type or more recently of the swarm intelligence type. Both of these algorithmic types are discussed in chapters 4 and 5 respectively.
\section{Summary}
In this chapter a discussion was presented on the problem this dissertation is based upon. The problem was defined as being the \gls{FAP} and is categorised as being part of the set of NP-Complete problems. The NP-Complete nature of the problem is an important concept to understand.

Within the \gls{FAP} domain there are two different techniques when assigning frequencies. The two different techniques were discussed in section~\ref{sec:FreqAssignmentTypes}. 

An important concept that needs to be understood to comprehend why the \gls{FAP} exists is the concept of interference. This was discussed in depth in section~\ref{sec:Interference}.

The \gls{FAP} is not just one problem but consists of various sub problems that have different goals for the resulting frequency plan. Some problems are concerned with the number of frequencies used, others are more concerned with the amount of interference that is generated on the network.
The various \gls{FAP} sub problems were outlined and discussed in section~\ref{sec:FAPVariants}.

A formal mathematical definition of the \gls{MI-FAP} was also presented. Finally, this chapter concluded with a discussion on the different industries where the FAP is encountered and how the problem is handled.
